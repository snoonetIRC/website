            <p>#R4R Channel Rules</p>
<p>(Note: All subreddit rules are also required to be followed, visit the sidebar of the subreddit if you don&rsquo;t know them. Snoonet rules are also to be followed and enforced)</p>
<p>Channel is strictly 18+</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be an asshole. This goes for sexist generalizations, racist and homophobic slurs/remarks, ad hominems, being obnoxious, etc. In general, respect people&rsquo;s boundaries and be civil. If someone finds your humor or choice of topic offensive, please respect that. If you feel that someone is being rude to you, please speak up and/or notify a mod as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attention &ldquo;whoring&rdquo; is not tolerated in the channel. This means being overtly sexual, spamming pictures of yourself, asking for compliments, and just general attention seeking comments. Mods have the right to decide what is considered to be attention &ldquo;whoring&rdquo; and have the right to warn, kick, and ban if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to talk dirty? Do it in a PM. Want to send nudes? Do it in a PM. Want to ask for pictures? Do it in a PM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For links containing nudity, please tag them NSFW when they are posted. People do IRC from work! For privacy and safety reasons, send nudes via PM and only when both parties want to send/see said pictures. Not everyone wants to see your, your brother&rsquo;s, your grandma&rsquo;s or your next door neighbour&rsquo;s butt. Public decency. Please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blatant trolling, extreme creepy behavior, or making serious personal threats will typically be met with an immediate ban. However, since not every situation is the same, OPs reserve the right to warn/kick/ban as they see fit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not come into the channel asking &ldquo;ASL,&rdquo; &ldquo;WHERE R THE GIRLS?&rdquo; &ldquo;HOT GRLS PM ME!&rdquo; and saying that the channel is a sausagefest. This is not a meat market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending pms to those in the channel you do not know is prohobited, especially if they may be considered creepy or unsolicited. That includes asking ASL to every single person or messaging people with names that might seem &lsquo;female&rsquo; PMing should be secondary to communication in the channel. Talk to the people, get to know them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing said in here is private. However, don&rsquo;t post people&rsquo;s personal information without their consent (i.e., real names, Facebook profiles, etc.) This also includes scraping information from the chat and/or posting personal information from the chat publicly on the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a chat regular, try to be friendly and welcoming to new people who are coming in. Also, if someone comes to the chat to discuss something serious, please don&rsquo;t blow them off or make insensitive comments. We were all new at some point, and it can often be hard for newcomers to fit in with the group at first, so please take that into consideration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Instant Kick Rules/Policies:</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>Making sleazy comments towards people in the chat room, such as &ldquo;I can help with that&rdquo;, asking for pics, highlighting the presence or absence of women in the chatroom and offensive racial, homophobic, transphobic, and sexist slurs. It&rsquo;s obnoxious. Harmless joking is fine, of course, but use common sense. Example: <a href="http://xkcd.com/322/">http://xkcd.com/322/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spamming of our channel bots, gonzobot and any other possible additions, can clog up the channel and make it difficult for people to have conversations. If OPs think you are using the bots a little too much within the channel, you will be asked to use the bot in a PM. If you continue spamming the Bot, you will be kicked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idling for weeks at a time without ever contributing to the channel. Don&rsquo;t be that creepy person watching all of us.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Zero Tolerance / Instant Ban Rules:</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>
<p>Blatant spamming/trolling. If you are coming into the chat under a different nick to troll, then every other nick you try to use will be banned as well. Note on sending your picture repeatedly to the channel: people are required to keep a bit of decency. Repeatedly posting pictures of yourself is not only frowned upon and makes a lot of people complain but is also kickable and eventually bannable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being underage - #r4r is strictly over-18 and we will apply the same rule we do in 

    <a href="https://reddit.com/r/r4r">/r/r4r</a>. Of course this is very complicated to control, but we&rsquo;ll try our best.</p>
</li>
</ol>
