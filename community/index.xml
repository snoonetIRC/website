      <description>Στο Ελληνικό chat του zougla.gr μπορείτε να επικοινωνείτε γρήγορα και εύκολα με ασφαλή τρόπο.
Συζητείστε για ό,τι σας απασχολεί, ανταλλάξτε απόψεις, κάντε νέες γνωριμίες και φίλους.
Διαβάστε τους κανόνες και την πολιτική λειτουργίας για να γνωρίζετε τι ΔΕΝ πρέπει να κάνετε κατά την είσοδό σας.
Κανόνες και πολιτική λειτουργίας:
Το zougla.gr κατατάσσεται στις καλύτερες ιστοσελίδες στην Ελλάδα σύμφωνα με το Alexa Rank.
Οι χρήστες που συνδέονται στο #zougla οφείλουν να γνωρίζουν τους κανόνες και την πολιτική λειτουργίας του καναλιού.
Κύριος στόχος του καναλιού είναι η ανταλλαγή απόψεων και η δημιουργία συζητήσεων που δεν προσβάλλουν την ανθρώπινη υπόσταση και δεν στοχοποιούν συγκεκριμένες ομάδες ατόμων.
Βασικός στόχος είναι η ψυχαγωγία και όχι η προώθηση πολιτικών και θρησκευτικών πεποιθήσεων, απόψεις που δεν ενστερνίζονται όλοι.
Απαγορεύεται η χρήση προσωνύμιων που έχουν ρατσιστικό/σεξουαλικό ή άλλο χαρακτήρα, που θα μπορούσε να προσβάλλει κάποιο άλλο μέλος ή ολόκληρο το κανάλι, κάθε είδους διαφημίσεις Spam/Ιστοσελίδων/Blog που έχουν ως σκοπό οποιονδήποτε κερδοσκοπικό χαρακτήρα και τέλος κάθε είδους μορφή κατάχρησης όπως Flooding/Abuse των υπηρεσιών που σας παρέχονται.
Πώς μπορώ να γίνω operator(@) στο #zougla;
Η θέση του operator έχει περισσότερες ευθύνες σε σχέση με έναν απλό χρήστη και δεν είναι απλά ένας τίτλος.
Για να γίνει κάποιος operator στο #zougla θα πρέπει:
 Να συμμετέχει ενεργά στο κανάλι και να μην δημιουργεί προβλήματα χωρίς λόγο. Να σέβεται τα υπόλοιπα μέλη του #zougla ανεξάρτητα από το αν έχουν παραπάνω προνόμια. Να γνωρίζει τουλάχιστον τις βασικές εντολές και την λειτουργία του IRC. Να μην μπλέκει τις προσωπικές του διαφωνίες με το κανάλι.  Τα ban για προσωπικές διαφωνίες με άλλους χρήστες είναι λόγος διαγραφής operator.
Τα μόνιμα op(@) δεν μπορούν να μοιράζονται αυθαίρετα και σε άτομα που δεν γνωρίζουν σε μεγάλο βαθμό το IRC.
Κάθε άτομο που συχνάζει στο chat αποτυπώνει ένα χαρακτήρα και συνεπώς με την συμπεριφορά του αξιολογείται για το αν πρέπει ή όχι να αποκτήσει κάποιο προνόμιο.
Τα προσωπικά μηνύματα των χρηστών παρακολουθούνται/καταγράφονται;
Οι διαχειριστές/operators του #zougla δεν είναι σε θέση να γνωρίζουν/παρακολουθούν τα μηνύματα που ανταλλάσσετε μεταξύ σας (προσωπικά μηνύματα) και επομένως δεν φέρουν καμία ευθύνη για ενδεχόμενες μη νόμιμες ενέργειές σας.
Η διεύθυνση IP από την οποία συνδέομαι είναι ορατή σε άλλους χρήστες;
Οι πραγματικές IP διευθύνσεις των χρηστών που συνδέονται στο #zougla δεν είναι ορατές για λόγους προστασίας των προσωπικών σας δεδομένων.
Γιατί να κατοχυρώσω το ψευδώνυμό (nickname) μου;
Το ψευδώνυμο, είναι απαραίτητο για να σας αναγνωρίζουν οι υπόλοιποι, και σας δίνει μια ταυτότητα στο θέμα συζήτησης που θα συμμετάσχετε.</description>

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community: what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include
 We do. I like to change up the colors on our CSS page for different holidays throughout the year. We also have a neat announcement bar that pops up when you scroll down, it normally has a quirky quote on it.  What sets your community apart from others?
  /r/CasualConversation is a subreddit for general chat about almost anything that you can think of. The main rules here are to &amp;ldquo;respect others&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t take things too seriously.&amp;rdquo; Mostly we just want people to have a friendly place to have conversations but we do have a detailed rules page here. Oh we also have a Snoonet rules page.  We have a bunch of resources for our community, our Steam group, Music room, Minecraft server and of course our Snoonet channel.
What inspired this community?
 I was looking through reddit to find a general chat type subreddit but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one. So I thought I would try and make my own and well I guess it worked. Sort of like an &amp;ldquo;off topic&amp;rdquo; like what you would see on message boards but for reddit.  What sets your community apart from others?
 Our community is extremely friendly. Maybe even too friendly. We also have pretty great CSS on our sub.  What is your goal with this community?
 To have a place to chat with strangers with a great atmosphere.  What is your community (in)famous for?
 Idk I guess just circlejerking about how friendly we are.  What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?
 So&amp;hellip; I had a birthday and got no gifts. I think this shows a lot of what this community is all about.  Do you have any favorite quotes or posts from your users?
 I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I went digging I would find the one I liked but I just can&amp;rsquo;t think of it at the moment.  What do you hope your community gains from this subreddit?
 A sense of learning how to be an all around better person, sharing your stories and maybe making some new friends. Some threads in the sub has already show how our sub has impacted people&amp;rsquo;s lives for the better.</description>

      <description>#dag is a channel created by people - for people.

      <description>( /r/TrollChromosomes)
Can you give us a description of your community: what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?
 We are #TrollChromsomes, the official IRC Chat for all the troll subs, mainly TrollXChromosomes and TrollYChromosome. We welcome all to come check us out! We are a safe and friendly place, and whether you go to the troll subs or just have found us from the server, we&amp;rsquo;d love to have you. The more the merrier. But even your favorite bar has rules, and you can find ours here  What inspired this community?
 One day two of the original founders separately saw a post in /r/trollx advertising the newly made subreddit of /r/troll4troll. They started a conversation in the comments that there should be an IRC channel for the community and later on that day (Friday, May 2nd 2014) we had a channel created over on Freenode. Not even a month later we were moved to Snoonet for a variety of reasons.  What sets your community apart from others?
 We wanted to be welcoming to people and we&amp;rsquo;ve been told by numerous users that we&amp;rsquo;re the friendliest channel on the server. Most of our users tell us they haven&amp;rsquo;t even wandered out to the rest of Snoonet or IRC. But besides the friendliness? Imagine all of the openness, humor, and sense of community you feel in both TrollX and TrollY? Well that&amp;rsquo;s what you get with #TrollChromosomes!  What is your goal with this community?
 Being an offshoot of the TrollX/YChromosome(s) communities, we strive to make all trolls happy. If you like IRC and you like TrollX and TrollY, then hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy the chat with us. We just like having a place where people can hangout and reply to people instantly, instead of like on the website where comments are a lot slower and it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes not as easy to make friends that way unless you are very active in the communities. It&amp;rsquo;s also easier to make friends in the channel if you&amp;rsquo;re more of a lurker in the subreddits.  What is your community (in)famous for?
 We are famous for our kindness and friendliness! We are still young though and there are so many cool things we have planned!  What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?
 This is the most popular post and honestly I think it represents us pretty well sometimes: http://redd.</description>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/neopets/rules/</guid>
      <description>Welcome to the ##neopets IRC channel!
This is a place for Neopians to discuss things. Have fun, relax, join in the conversations, or start your own conversation. There are some rules that you will need to abide by, in addition to the general Snoonet Rules:
 No racism, homophobia, transphobia, harassment, or bigotry of any kind. Don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick. The Channel OPs reserve the right to interpret dickishness. No flooding or spamming the channel. Do not ask for personal information. Do not post personal information of others. This is grounds for a network ban. Mark all NSFW or NSFL links as such. If you can&amp;rsquo;t open it in front of a church, it needs to be marked. Respect your fellow users. No harassment or trolling of any kind. If you want to talk dirty, send nudes, or use bigoted language: do it in PM. If you want to argue about the channel rules, do it in PM.  Multiple warnings will result in removal from the channel or a ban. All kicks/removals/bans are at the discretion of the channel OPs.
If you have any issues with a user in the channel or need help you can type the name of an OP to get their attention, or you can /msg opsname message.
 If you are new to IRC here are a few starter commands— To change your name from a Snooname:
/nick username  To set auto-join:
/msg NickServ AJOIN ADD ##neopets  When you&amp;rsquo;ve picked a nick that you like and you are ready to hang around, we recommend registering your name:
/msg NickServ REGISTER password email  See Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s Help and; Guidelines for more.</description>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/partymansion/rules/</guid>
      <description>We want ##PartyMansion to be a fun place for hedonism, coke, booze, strippers, and Dr Phil worship. Don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick and spoil the party for everyone else. Since &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick&amp;rdquo; seems to be misunderstood, here is a comprehensive list of rules in place that you will need to follow in order for ##PartyMansion to remain a happy place of food porn, shitty music, and poor meme-ing.
##PartyMansion&amp;rsquo;s Rules:
  Don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick. &amp;ndash; To expand, don&amp;rsquo;t do anything to intentionally attack another user. If a channel op requests for you to stop; stop. Failure to do so will result in a kick/quiet, and possibly a channel ban. Depending on the nature of the incident, the ban may be permanent. We have a very strong no-dick policy.
  No real names! Refrain from using the names of users in the channel - respect their right to privacy and refer to them by their IRC nicks only.
  Don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick.
  No homophobic/racist/transphobic/sexist or otherwise discriminatory language or sentiments. Please bear in mind that not everyone is from the same walk of life as you are, words you might find acceptable can be offensive to others. In these cases, please refer to Rule #1.
  Don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick.
  No excessive bot spam. Bots in their nature can be very spammy and we understand this, but please respect the channel and exercise restraint.
  Don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick.
  No flooding. If you have logs or something similar to post, put them in a paste at either privatepaste.com or pastebin.com.
  Don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick.
  Tag your NSFW pictures/links.
  Don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick.
  Lurking is discouraged. We regularly remove lurkers from the channel, so please make an attempt to be part of the community. This is us looking out for our channel regulars and not a slight on you &amp;ndash; a channel filled with lurkers is a channel filled with potential leaks. Lurking in its broadest sense is failure to participate in the channel after multiple warnings/pings, yet being active elsewhere.
  If any problems arise, feel free to contact a channel op/halfop via PM.
&amp;ndash;Please note that all kicks/bans are at the discretion of the channel ops. If you have concerns with any of the decisions made then please contact one of the ops via private message so as not to disrupt the channel further&amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>In addition to the usual Snoonet network rules, follow the channel rules:
 DON&amp;rsquo;T BE A SHITWEASEL. Mods reserve the right to interpret shitweaselness. No sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, harassment or rudeness will be tolerated. If you are experiencing current harassment in the chat, whether in the main room or private chat, please copy the log and email the transcript to an active op, or if none are available to Ops@TrollChromosomes.com and the mods will respond appropriately. No unsolicited PMs. This means you. Do not advertise. This includes, but is not limited to, public spam, private message spam, repeated solicitation of services, and solicitation of other network channels. Posting the personal information of others is grounds for a permanent ban. Attempting to collect personal info of users is dealt with in the same manner. A good rule of thumb is if you have to log into to see it, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t share it. Exchanges for money, goods, or services are strictly prohibited. No NSFW links allowed unless it relates to political content. Please respect your fellow users. Do not intentionally harass other users. This includes &amp;ldquo;trolling.&amp;rdquo; Get along with others! We understand that there are multiple types of humor, but do not excessively attack any other user on this network. Please note that sarcasm doesn&amp;rsquo;t translate well over IRC. Please be mindful that this is an internet chat room mostly consisting of trollX- &amp;amp; Yers – we enjoy the fact that we can have a friendly, welcoming atmosphere for people that can also be very flirty and sexual too. If anyone asks you to back off because they feel uncomfortable from your attention or words, please feel mindful that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a personal attack on you but instead the person in question just wants to feel comfortable. 18+ members only Want to talk dirty? Do it in a PM. Want to send nudes? Do it in PM.  </description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re the official IRC channel for the subreddit /r/aspergers. You can sum us up in two words: socializing and support. Our primary function is to be a place for people on the entire Autistic Spectrum to have a safe and friendly place to chat, socialize, and discuss anything and everything. We&amp;rsquo;re also a support channel for folks dealing with a new diagnosis, mental health issues, or needing general advice. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re diagnosed or not, everyone is welcome!
We&amp;rsquo;ve got people on at all times of the day, across all sorts of time-zones. Activity wanes and grows all the time but you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to idle about for as long as you want, or jump in and start or join a conversation. If you need any help, just chat to one of the channel staff and we&amp;rsquo;ll get back to you as soon as we&amp;rsquo;re available.
We look forward to seeing you in the channel soon and we hope you have fun. You can see some more information about the channel and our rules here.</description>

      <description>All operator actions are discretionary. If an op asks you do something, there is probably a good reason for it! If you want to argue your case, either head over to the channel ##AspergersOpTalk or PM us. We can be reasonable.
All Network rules cascade down to all channels. Read the snoonet network rules here.
Our channel rules are as follows
 Be respectful towards other users. Bullying and attacking people for any reason will not be tolerated. Stalking or broadcasting personally identifiable information about a user will result in an immediate and permanent ban. Keep debates friendly and constructive. See the section &amp;ldquo;On debates&amp;rdquo; for more information. You are expected to be reasonably appropriate. This means, for example, don&amp;rsquo;t engage in sexual roleplay in the public channel Don&amp;rsquo;t bring outside drama into the channel! Resolve it in private. No spamming. Tag all NSFW content, this includes links and image links Please keep any logs of the channel private, some users may share things in channel that they would prefer not sent to others outside of the channel  On debates: It appears that the stereotype that people on the Spectrum love to argue is true! We often have debates in the channel about all sorts of interesting topics. Our userbase has many differing opinions, and it can be fun to challenge and discuss these. But remember that there is a fine line between a healthy debate and a fight. Do not exchange insults, do not provoke someone who is not interested in a debate, and do not be abusive toward someone who disagrees with you. If you start personally attacking someone for their beliefs, you&amp;rsquo;ve automatically lost the argument and you might be kicked by an operator. In other words; play nice.
Debates can also get out of hand and start disrupting the normal flow of conversation of the channel. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy for only a few debating people to totally dominate the channel. It&amp;rsquo;s also very easy for you to become impassioned by an on-going debate, and not see how your conversation is obstructing other people from speaking. Be mindful of this. If an Op asks you to stop or move the debate, please do so. Check out the below section &amp;ldquo;On #aspergers-alt&amp;rdquo; for information on where you can go to continue your debate elsewhere.
On general behaviour: Even though most of us are on the Autistic Spectrum, you should have a general idea of what is polite and socially acceptable.</description>

Rules Be what you want other people to be. Like on the /r/casualconversation, when in the channel you should aim to be as polite as possible. This makes others feel welcome and conversations can take place without users being rude to one another.
 Respect others.  Remember—you&amp;rsquo;re speaking with humans.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t take things too seriously.  Keep it casual. We are all here to have a nice time chatting it up so let&amp;rsquo;s all just have a good time.

      <description>#depression-alt Purpose #depression-alt provides a space away from #depression where the rules are relaxed. Certain topics normally prohibited in the main channel will be permitted here, meaning that discretion is advised.
If you can not handle discussion of self harm and/or more specific suicide methods, it is advised to immediately /part or /leave the channel. Network and channel rules still apply. Please see below for more information.
Channel Operators The team handling #depression-alt is the same team that currently handles the #depression channel.
If you need to contact an operator for assistance, you may find a list of operators by clicking here.
Rules &amp;amp; Guidelines  In order to encourage open discussion, try to keep discussions in the channel. Please use discretion when discussing certain sensitive topics (such as politics and/or religion) in the channel. You may not advertise your own channel or service through our channel or directly through our users unless authorization has been provided by channel operators. Please refrain from bringing drama into our channel from other IRC channels. Additionally, please do not share others&#39; personal information in the channel. Graphic depictions of specific suicide/self harm methods and abuse as well as glorification of suicide/self harm are prohibited in this channel. Any decisions made by our operators are final. If you believe that a decision made by particular operator is unfair, please try talking to that operator directly, or message another channel operator.  </description>

      <description>#R4R Channel Rules
(Note: All subreddit rules are also required to be followed, visit the sidebar of the subreddit if you don&amp;rsquo;t know them. Snoonet rules are also to be followed and enforced)
Channel is strictly 18+
  Don&amp;rsquo;t be an asshole. This goes for sexist generalizations, racist and homophobic slurs/remarks, ad hominems, being obnoxious, etc. In general, respect people&amp;rsquo;s boundaries and be civil. If someone finds your humor or choice of topic offensive, please respect that. If you feel that someone is being rude to you, please speak up and/or notify a mod as soon as possible.
  Attention &amp;ldquo;whoring&amp;rdquo; is not tolerated in the channel. This means being overtly sexual, spamming pictures of yourself, asking for compliments, and just general attention seeking comments. Mods have the right to decide what is considered to be attention &amp;ldquo;whoring&amp;rdquo; and have the right to warn, kick, and ban if necessary.
  Want to talk dirty? Do it in a PM. Want to send nudes? Do it in a PM. Want to ask for pictures? Do it in a PM.
  For links containing nudity, please tag them NSFW when they are posted. People do IRC from work! For privacy and safety reasons, send nudes via PM and only when both parties want to send/see said pictures. Not everyone wants to see your, your brother&amp;rsquo;s, your grandma&amp;rsquo;s or your next door neighbour&amp;rsquo;s butt. Public decency. Please.
  Blatant trolling, extreme creepy behavior, or making serious personal threats will typically be met with an immediate ban. However, since not every situation is the same, OPs reserve the right to warn/kick/ban as they see fit.
  Do not come into the channel asking &amp;ldquo;ASL,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;WHERE R THE GIRLS?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;HOT GRLS PM ME!&amp;rdquo; and saying that the channel is a sausagefest. This is not a meat market.
  Sending pms to those in the channel you do not know is prohobited, especially if they may be considered creepy or unsolicited. That includes asking ASL to every single person or messaging people with names that might seem &amp;lsquo;female&amp;rsquo; PMing should be secondary to communication in the channel. Talk to the people, get to know them!
  Nothing said in here is private. However, don&amp;rsquo;t post people&amp;rsquo;s personal information without their consent (i.e., real names, Facebook profiles, etc.) This also includes scraping information from the chat and/or posting personal information from the chat publicly on the internet.</description>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/reddit/rules/</guid>
      <description>Be reasonable and keep conversation interesting! We understand humor of all sorts, but don&amp;rsquo;t excessively attack or belittle another user in the channel. And though minor racist or otherwise abusive remarks may be accepted as a matter of course on IRC as well as Reddit, don&amp;rsquo;t make it your mission to &amp;lsquo;pick on&amp;rsquo; another user. Excessive racism and bigotry is not tolerated, and punishable by a ban.
Linking Tag links that are NSFW as [NSFW] - not every one wants to view mature content. Many are chatting from households, work offices, or just flat out don&amp;rsquo;t want to see that kind of stuff. Failure to do so will result in a warning and an eventual ban. Do not publish referral links without asking openly in the channel if people don&amp;rsquo;t mind you doing so. We&amp;rsquo;re not your army, but we also don&amp;rsquo;t mind helping friends in need.
Support your arguments Arguing with others is fine; it&amp;rsquo;s the way of life. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re going to argue a point to someone, maintain the high ground and be able to support your arguments with facts. As a whole we hate whiny arguments, so if you&amp;rsquo;re going to argue be smart about it and at least give others a reason to side with you.
Don&amp;rsquo;t flood and don&amp;rsquo;t repeat lines You will be automatically punished (a quiet or a kick) for doing so. If you continue to do it, it will be grounds for a channel ban.
Don&amp;rsquo;t be easily offended Don&amp;rsquo;t let remarks get to you. If something or someone on IRC is bothering you, discuss it with a channel operator. Keep in mind that if you&amp;rsquo;re offended often in #reddit, then the real world has quite a few surprises for you.</description>

Multiple warnings will result in removal from the channel or a ban. All kicks/removals/bans are at the discretion of the channel OPs.

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/troll_nsfw/rules/</guid>
      <description>In addition to the usual Snoonet network rules, follow the channel rules:
 DON&amp;rsquo;T BE A SHITWEASEL. Mods reserve the right to interpret shitweaselness. No sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, harassment or rudeness will be tolerated. If you are experiencing current harassment in the chat, whether in the main room or private chat, please copy the log and email the transcript to Ops@TrollChromosomes.com and the mods will respond appropriately. No unsolicited PMs. This means you. Do not advertise. This includes, but is not limited to, public spam, private message spam, repeated solicitation of services, and solicitation of other network channels. Posting the personal information of others is grounds for a permanent ban. Attempting to collect personal info of users is dealt with in the same manner. A good rule of thumb is if you have to log into to see it, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t share it. Exchanges for money, goods, or services are strictly prohibited. Assume all links are NSFW. It&amp;rsquo;s still a good idea to mark them, and be as descriptive as possible. Please respect your fellow users. Do not intentionally harass other users. This includes &amp;ldquo;trolling.&amp;rdquo; Get along with others! We understand that there are multiple types of humor, but do not excessively attack any other user on this network. Please note that sarcasm doesn&amp;rsquo;t translate well over IRC. Please be mindful that this is an internet chat room mostly consisting of trollX- &amp;amp; Yers – we enjoy the fact that we can have a friendly, welcoming atmosphere for people that can also be very flirty and sexual too. If anyone asks you to back off because they feel uncomfortable from your attention or words, please feel mindful that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a personal attack on you but instead the person in question just wants to feel comfortable. 18+ members only Want to talk dirty? Do it in a PM. Want to send nudes? You can do it in the channel, but remember, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people in this channel. Do not make a big deal about the presence or absence of women in channel. The same goes for demanding pics, making a big deal about someone being female, specifically looking for women to talk to, etc.  If you do not follow the rules, you may be muted, kicked, and/or banned at the discretion of the ops. If you have an issue with this, message the mod in question. Don&amp;rsquo;t drag your drama into the main channel or other channels.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Being an Op in #anxiety</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/anxiety/mods/</link>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/anxiety/mods/</guid>
      <description>What is my job as an op? Help keep the channel as a safe and healing place that&amp;rsquo;s enjoyable to all who stop by and/or frequent the channel. Do this by:  Be kind, remember to mind triggers like everyone else Making users feel welcome (welcoming new users to the channel when you can and involving users in conversations) Overseeing conversations in channel and keeping an eye out for rule breakers and trolls Stop people that are there solely to cause trouble (trolls - those pushing buttons on purpose) or anyone harassing another user Also by being a voiced user it lets other users know you are someone to PM if they are having issues either personal, or in the channel For any user that seems to be or claims to be suicidal, refer them to the suicide hotline 1 (800) 273-8255 - National Suicide Prevention Lifeline or http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html. We are not professionals. If the problem persists, warn them that you will have to mute or ban them, if they persist; remove their chat privilege with !mute or !ban  When issues come up what is the protocol for dealing with them? If you are online and available to users, stay oped in the channel, and de-oped if you are offline, busy, or otherwise unavailable. To op yourself just type in: !op and !deop to de-op yourself.
 Use your discretion when dealing with problematic users. Sometimes a simple topic change could handle the situation. Sometimes a user may deserve a warning. Sometimes a user will not relent until they are banned. You may choose to PM a user about their behavior or maybe just gently prod them in channel. However you choose to do it, a warning is preferred before any more severe action. Try referring people to the link to #anxiety rules in the topic. Typically, the process should be:   Warning (You may do this as many times as you feel necessary) Removal (You may do this as many times as you feel necessary) Ban (If a user returns after being banned, contact Snoonet staff as it is against Snoonet policy)   Use this document to track troublemakers. Please try to include a reason and/or expiration for your bans when appropriate. Expiration is specified as an integer followed by one of d (days), h (hours), or m (minutes). Combinations (such as 1h30m) are not permitted. Feel free to discuss issues with your fellow ops/voiced users in #anxietymods.</description>

      <title>#psychic</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/psychic/</link>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/psychic/</guid>
      <description>Can you give us a description of your community: what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?
#Psychic is the official chatroom for /r/Psychic, the largest reddit community for psychics, intuitives, empaths or people interested in extrasensory perception.
The chatroom mostly serves as a place to chill and chat about anything, including topical things like psychics! Our rules are pretty simple, you can find them here. We also have a good resource for IRC information and help here if ever it&amp;rsquo;s required.
What inspired this community?
It was on a sunny April in 2016, when our resident Dane Luhaja was on a walk through Denmark, when something came to him. The wind, breezed across his face, as he attempted mindfulness. Finally, a psychic connection was made, and a vision came to him, &amp;ldquo;We need a chatroom&amp;rdquo;. Some say he frantically* ran to his computer, made a post to /r/Psychic in the hopes that his dreams would come true. Then, a mod appeared. They agreed, and the chatroom was made. The rest, as they say, is history.
*might be slightly embellished
What sets your community apart from others?
We are the largest psychic-related IRC channel (and subreddit) and we&amp;rsquo;ve all developed a close bond with each other.
There&amp;rsquo;s also the fact that we have literal occultists and spirit talkers here but that&amp;rsquo;s neither here nor there.
What is your goal with this community?
To create a chat for people with like-minded beliefs, but also to create a healthy environment that everyone can feel welcome to.
Does your community have any traditions or special events?
Aside from a secret santa/exchange we do, not particularly. Meetups have been organised before though.</description>

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community: what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include? Its about people. About people who had out of body experiences (aka astral projections) and a place for them to express that. Its also for people wants to learn about them. We are the biggest subreddit in this niche. Mainly because our founders came together from three different subreddits with the same niche. We are happy to serve 4K people as of the time of writing this.
What inspired this community? A year or two back there were 3 (including this one) astral projection related subreddits. I use to frequent this one and sent a message to the mod of this sub(at that time) that I can help with css if he ever needs it. But that mod abandoned the sub and never got my message. Then as luck would have it , a new mod (/u/lobob123 ) took over this sub. /u/lobob123 read my message and replied back saying he was happy to receive any css help. I (/u/DaMan123456 ) of course accepted and did my best to upgrade the css and clean the sub. I really wanted to help out. While we were chatting and working on making /r/AstralProjection the best we could make it, we thought &amp;ldquo;why don&amp;rsquo;t we merge all the other related subs into one? This way we can a)serve more people and b) have all the information in one place.&amp;rdquo; And then me and /u/lobob123 set out do exactly that. We told our vision to make one big subreddit to /u/Captain_Midnight who at the time was running /r/OutOfBody. It was the second biggest to our sub. He was very kind and went along with the merger. Then came /r/astralprojectionnow. This sub had no mods, so I become the mod of this sub and then redirected everyone to /r/AstralProjection. Along the way we recieved help from /u/Psichonaut . So us four mods share a really cool connection in making all of this possible. But its mainly thanks to our readers we are here.
So TLDR: A desire to help out and a desire to be one big repository to and for all astral projection / out of body experience related thigns made this sub what it is.
What sets your community apart from others? We like to think its our helping attitude and commitment to our readers.</description>

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community: what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?
 Our community serves the purpose of discussing Portugal or portuguese in the world, that&amp;rsquo;s our main rule too.  What inspired this community?
 There was a need for it I guess.  What sets your community apart from others?
 We&amp;rsquo;re a friendly people and like to help strangers. We also have francesinhas and pastéis de nata.  What is your goal with this community?
 Discuss everything related to our beautiful country and help each others out.  What is your community (in)famous for?
 We once made the news but we don&amp;rsquo;t like to talk about that.  What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?
 Photos of an old Portugal. We have a flair just for our best posts and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best there.  Do you have any favorite quotes or posts from your users?
 &amp;ldquo;Bitoque Caralho&amp;rdquo;  What have you learned from being a part of this community?
 I learned a lot about a range of subjects but I mostly developed a thick skin for some stuff  Does your community have any traditions or special events?
 On friday, every two weeks we have a thread where we discuss anything, in the other weeks we have a cultural thread. Sometimes we do some cultural exchanges with other national subreddits.  Does your community have any associated social media or websites? (facebook/twitter/instagram/etc) Also, follow us on Twitter!

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community: what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?
 It&amp;rsquo;s fairly self explanatory, really. It&amp;rsquo;s the national subreddit for the country, Scotland! Open to any and all, though we have our number one rule that each post must be related to Scottish matters (either directly or indirectly).  What inspired this community?
 Again, self-explanatory - it&amp;rsquo;s the national subreddit! Much like /r/Columbia or /r/Iran.  What sets your community apart from others?
 We are extremely sarcastic, but very friendly. It sounds somewhat oxymoronic but hey - we like to think of ourselves complicated.  What is your goal with this community?
 Online bonds, general banter, sharing of news, making friends or a support group - whatever our subscribers want it to be.  What is your community (in)famous for?
 Swearing. Irreverence in general, really! We can take a joke, we can laugh at ourselves, we are very strongly opinionated but we are very friendly and I like to think helpful too :)  What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?
 That&amp;rsquo;s an easy one. This post of this image, during the referendum. That was a period of great turmoil in the sub!  Do you have any favorite quotes or posts from your users?
 I have one user in particular who I always enjoy reading comments from, but I won&amp;rsquo;t mention their name here as it would be a personal choice and it&amp;rsquo;s not up to me to mention them! But one of their comments that I love was on the topic of what it feels like to get kicked in the nuts: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s more like pain and nausea had a baby together, and that baby is trying to gnaw it&amp;rsquo;s way downward and out through your guts and ballsack.&amp;rdquo;  What have you learned from being a part of this community?
 Develop a thick skin. Don&amp;rsquo;t rise to the gr8 b8 m8.  Does your community have any traditions or special events?
 Hunners. The Homecoming, Rabbie Burns Night, St Andrew&amp;rsquo;s Day, Haggis, Irn Bru, Whisky&amp;hellip;the list goes on :)  Does your community have any associated social media or websites? (facebook/twitter/instagram/etc) Also, follow us on Twitter!

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community?  /r/army is a community dedicated mostly to past, present, and future members of the United States Army, although it is open to other branches of the military, service men and women from other countries, and those who are just interested in the Army and its culture. We ask each other questions about daily goings-on, share pertinent news, support one another, entertain ourselves, and have informational threads where people can ask questions about the military on an open floor. It is not official nor does it necessarily represent the opinion of the US Army.</description>

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community: what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?
 Hi, we&amp;rsquo;re the #BadSubHub, otherwise known as the de facto /r/badhistory IRC channel (although anyone else on the badacademic subreddits are encouraged to come visit).   /r/badhistory is the place where you can see bad history get taken down, in many cases with great aplomb. It&amp;rsquo;s /r/AskHistorians at the pub, where we&amp;rsquo;re all raging drunk and swearing like sailors.
We&amp;rsquo;re also part of the general /r/BadSubHub academy, which also includes subs like /r/badscience, /r/badlinguistics, /r/badlegaladvice, and /r/bad_religion. If there&amp;rsquo;s a discipline, there&amp;rsquo;s probably a badacademia subreddit for you to submit to.
The rest of the post will be dealing with /r/badhistory specifically, as most users in the IRC are /r/badhistory users.
What inspired this community?
 It all started a long time ago, when one user decided that we need a sub to feature the large amounts of bad history found all over Reddit. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve grown to be the largest badacademia sub, complete with injokes and Nazi moderators all on our own.  What sets your community apart from others?
  /r/badhistory is known for Rule 5, or the &amp;ldquo;explain why your submission is bad history&amp;rdquo; rule. It&amp;rsquo;s the reason why the subreddit hasn&amp;rsquo;t completely descended into mindless circlejerking (although we do still jerk) and the reason why many people are attracted to the subreddit.  What is your goal with this community?
 Our goal is to debunk and discuss bad history that shows up, whether it&amp;rsquo;s from an article, a Reddit comment, a blog post, a TV show, a porno (yes, really), a comic, a commercial, etc.  What is your community (in)famous for?
 We&amp;rsquo;re known for, and in no particular order, our R5, our injokes, our devotion to Volcano, our fascist-communist-theist-Whig-drunk-SJW-pinko-statist-reactionary moderation team, and for being literally SRS (see /r/badhistory/wiki/accusations)  What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?
 A PSA: Do not trust heavily upvoted responses in AskHistorians just because they are upvoted and gilded.  Do you have any favorite quotes or posts from your users?
 We recently did a /r/bestof2014 contest, found here. Here, you can find what our subreddit considered our greatest hits in 2014.  What do you hope your community gains from this subreddit?</description>

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community?
 Our community is founded on the discussion of heavy metal music and its related news and events. The IRC channel is more relaxed than the subreddit and non-metal related general discussion is encouraged. Homophobia and racism are not permitted in the channel or the subreddit.  What inspired this community?
 &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;Satan.  What sets your community apart from others?
 We&amp;rsquo;ve had continuous activity for a number of years. We&amp;rsquo;re busy 24/7. And if nobody&amp;rsquo;s talking, there&amp;rsquo;s still someone idling waiting for conversation.  What is your goal with this community?
 Our IRC community has been running with a fairly consistent number of users for over three years, and is currently one of Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s most active chats. We would like to continue in a similar fashion but extend an invitation to new users.  What is your community (in)famous for?
 Our lawyers say we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t talk about it right now. But we&amp;rsquo;re pretty famous for our unimpeachable musical recommendations! Not a fan of metal? Come hang out for a while and you will be.  What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?
 Our top post of all time is a self-post discussion thread about the death of Slayer&amp;rsquo;s Jeff Hanneman from 2013. Way to be a downer, question guy. How about this also-popular post regarding a petition to allow Gwar to play the 2015 Super Bowl Halftime Show instead?  Do you have any favorite quotes or posts from your users?
 We have a bot that handles quotes for us. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say there&amp;rsquo;s a reason why /u/dustin_the_wind has 29 quotes stored on the bot. &amp;lt; sabytmobile_&amp;gt; Dunwich? &amp;lt; Dunwich&amp;gt; sabyt? &amp;lt; sabytmobile_&amp;gt; Hi &amp;lt; Dunwich&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt; grisher&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt;@Mike&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt;@Shreddit&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt; t_deg&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt; Jalkion&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt; Blasphemophagher&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt; jesusfucknugget&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt; quorthon&amp;gt; hi &amp;lt; grrrreg&amp;gt; hi  What do you hope your community gains from this subreddit?
  /r/metal is primarily a place to share and discuss music. There&amp;rsquo;s so much new music out there that we can&amp;rsquo;t possibly hope to have it all in one place, so it spills over to #metal. We&amp;rsquo;re also a great place to come for more in-depth recommendations. Whether you like grindcore, black metal, stoner, thrash, doom or any of the million other subgenres of metal, there&amp;rsquo;s someone in #metal who has devoted his or her life to being a pedant about it!</description>

Vaporwave is a subculture that had started emerging at around 2010, and has become more prominent in the early 2010&amp;rsquo;s. The term originates from the term vaporware. It is considered a musical genre, as well as having a visual aesthetic. The genre has since developed and expanded, and the following is an attempt to describe &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; /r/vaporwave/w/basics</description>

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community? ##electronic is created for members all across the Snoonet network to have a place to discuss and share their Electronic Music finds. The channel is going to be a place where fans of eletronic music can all share their music. The channel itself has a subwatch bot which has a plethora of electronic findings and has a few subs equipped to share music. Some of those include EDM, Chillstep and ElectronicMusic. However, we are always looking forward to expanding our collection and would encourage any and every newcomer to share their music. We may not be at our keyboards all the time! but we will reply eventually.</description>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/subredditdrama/</guid>
      <description>/r/subredditdrama is where you go to watch other people on reddit argue. It was first started when there were several highly upvoted posts on /r/reddit.com about user-v-mod conflict. This is the very thread in which it was created.
Although it was initially founded to be a meta subreddit for general drama and calling out mod abuse, as the community grew (and became kinda witchhunt-y) new rules about neutrality were added and the subreddit&amp;rsquo;s purpose shifted to linking arguments. The mods idealize the subreddit as a place to draw entertainment out of other people fighting, but a lot of our users draw a lot of entertainment of discussing (and rehashing) the fights that are linked.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a meta redditor, if you like drama, or you want to know keep up with whatever current reddit shitstorm is brewing, /r/subredditdrama is the place.
 #subredditdrama is a casual channel for discussion of drama and just about anything else. Saying mean things about MillenniumFalc0n will earn you the respect of every one. Except MillenniumFalc0n, of course, because he hates fun.</description>

      <description>#worldbuilding is a DIY community centered on the activity of creating fictional worlds, either for fun or as part of the process of writing, making a tabletop RPG, or similar. All genres and experience levels are welcome. We also serve as an off-topic social space for the /r/worldbuilding community more generally.
Our community is small, intimate, and depth-focused. To this end, we are actively moderated in order to maintain an environment that is pleasant, productive, and conducive to detailed discussion. Because we are a DIY-focused community, we ask that you don&amp;rsquo;t try to get us to make content for you.
A number of our users are experts in particular fields, and we try to be helpful. Feel free to come to us for criticism, or to give feedback to others.

      <description>Why /r/writerchat
A lot of communities, here on Reddit and elsewhere, have a mythical veil placed around writing. It makes people believe that writing is something fantastical when it is not. Writer Chat is here to help de-mystify that veil and encourage everyone to write, with no crap added on.
We have a strong sense of community and welcome every writer, whether they are new to writing or already a professional. We are not limited to a genre; in fact, we encourage diversity. We hold weekly threads and monthly contests in order to encourage participation in the community.
We have an active chat room where a lot of the writers in the community like to hang out for live feedback in addition to just shooting the breeze. You can check it out at #writerchat on irc.snoonet.org
As for critiquing, a lot of people have complained about the lack of a strong online community to find critique partners. /r/writerchat aims to fill that gap.
A brief history of /r/writerchat
Writer Chat started out as a private chat room on a completely different server than Snoonet, with no subreddit whatsoever. In order to avoid Reddit drama and the works, the chat room was selective with whom it let enter.
After spending some time in the private chat room and developing our friendly neighborhood bot, Ampersand, the majority of the chat wanted to open doors to the public. Writer Chat then created a subreddit and moved to Snoonet, where it became public.
The subreddit was unused and unadvertised for five months until August 2016, when the moderators of the chat room decided to actively seek new members in order to expand. Weekly threads, word war weekends, and monthly contests were then implemented in order to help with expansion.
/r/writerchat goals
 /r/writerchat aims to be a community where writers of all kinds can gather and feel at home, whether it be in the chat room or on the subreddit. We ask our members to contribute to the community through critique and through content.
We have only two rules:
Don&amp;rsquo;t be an asshole Don&amp;rsquo;t make us add more rules Just these two rules have been the backbone of our attitudes and have worked well for over a year. Everyone in the community has a similar mindset for respect and helpfulness.
When you join IRC
You&amp;rsquo;ll be greeted by our friendly neighborhood bot, Ampersand. Don&amp;rsquo;t be alarmed!</description>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/writingprompts/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m /u/SurvivorType, Co-Lead Moderator of /r/WritingPrompts along with our founder /u/RyanKinder.
We are a subreddit and chat room dedicated to inspiring people to write! Find a prompt that moves you and respond with a story or a poem.
When I created my reddit account, the sub had around 235 subscribers. That seems like a long time ago now. Since then, we have become a default subreddit with nearly 2.5 million subscribers. That is quite a change.
One thing that has never changed is our commitment to getting people writing. That is what sets us apart from other communities. We don&amp;rsquo;t ask that you be polished. We don&amp;rsquo;t ask that you be published. All we ask is that you get writing. As long as you are willing to try, we want everyone to get involved.
There have been a number of incredible films and narrations created based on prompts and stories. You can find them in our wiki.
We also have a showcase for subscriber favorites at /r/bestofWritingPrompts where you can read some of the best content the subreddit has to offer. Anyone can post a story that would like to help an author get recognition on a prompt response.
We hold many contests throughout the year, culminating on our annual novelette contest. Reading the entries and seeing some of the talent demonstrated is an amazing experience.
Our chat room is a great place to come for both idle chit chat as well as ask for a critique on your writing. It&amp;rsquo;s a warm and welcoming environment where we offer plenty of help and encouragement in your writing endeavors. Discussions can range anywhere from gaming to subreddit policy, and everything in between. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s utter seething madness though. We kinda like it that way.
We hold word sprints in which we see who can write the most words in a set period of time on whatever story they happen to be working on. There is also a side project called Writer&amp;rsquo;s Tabletop™ Fantasy RPG which is a role playing game, now hosted in #wtfrpg.
Our main chat room is always open, so drop by and say hello. We hope to see you there!</description>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/100daysofketo/</guid>
      <description>Can you give us a description of your community: what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include? The 100daysofketo community is directly linked to our subreddit: /r/100daysofketo. It was started as a support community for people who are on the keto diet who wanted to commit to 100 days of keto eating. Every 100 days (or so), we start a new round with goal setting, and continue through the 100 days with various challenges and events to keep people motivated to succeed!
Our only rule is don&amp;rsquo;t be an asshole!
What inspired this community? Starting and sticking with a new diet is hard! Especially when it is as restrictive as keto can be sometimes. I know that when I started I felt really overwhelmed. Sometimes, even waiting 10 minutes for a response on a Reddit post was too long to wait and I had fallen off the wagon due to a misunderstanding or over-emotional problem. We started our online community as a way to provide immediate feedback and support and also to foster a more face-to-face interactive community for our users.
What sets your community apart from others? Compared to the other keto communities, we are less about the science and technical aspects and more about the day-in day-out nitty gritty of sticking to the diet. Our channel serves as another line of support for those days when you need assistance and just want to talk to someone who&amp;rsquo;s experiencing the same problems that you may be having. We&amp;rsquo;re all here to help each other!
What have you learned from being a part of this community? Our community and our participants are awesome! We have people participating in our challenges from all over the world and all walks of life. Keto is such an amazing tool for so many people and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to be a part of their success. Inspiring others has also made me a much more positive person.
Does your community have any traditions or special events? We have themed weekly threads that help keep the 100 days interesting, like Motivational Monday, Workout Wednesday, and Food Friday! We are very user-centric, so if you have a great idea for a new tradition, let us know!!

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/community/stopdrinking/</guid>
      <description>Can you give us a description of your community?
 Stopdrinking is a community for people to motivate each other to control or stop our drinking. We welcome anyone who wishes to join in by asking for help, offering advice from personal experience, sharing stories, or just encouraging someone who is trying to quit drinking or cut down on their alcohol consumption.  The general guidelines for participation are in the /r/stopdrinking wiki and there are some specific ones for IRC.
In the #stopdrinking channel we spend much of our time simply chatting and goofing around in a friendly and informal manner. However, the moment someone needs help or to talk seriously all that is needed is to say so and we drop our conversation, listen and try to help. If you are new, expect a bot and maybe a few humans to greet you when you first join but after that we won&amp;rsquo;t pester you. It&amp;rsquo;s left up to you to ask for help or to talk seriously. Otherwise, feel free to join in the banter or even just lurk. There is no &amp;ldquo;right way&amp;rdquo; to participate. The community guidelines can be checked to learn about the few &amp;ldquo;wrong ways&amp;rdquo; which are either discouraged or prohibited. In particular we ask that you do not participate in conversation when you are drinking.
What inspired this community?
 The initial inspiration and organization came from /u/Franks2000inchTV. It was based on his vision that everyone feel welcome regardless of how we are trying stop or control our drinking. Today, this inclusive acceptance remains a guiding principle with the current mod team.  Inspiration in the community is bolstered by individuals sharing the benefits of sobriety and by sharing new problem-solving strategies and coping methods that individuals develop to help them stay sober. Getting sober and maintaining a non-drinking lifestyle are difficult for many people to understand, as are the issues that arise in pursuing their goal. The majority of adults do not encounter problems related to drinking on a level that many people on SD experience. The world can be an isolating, scary, confusing place for the newly sober person. Members in the community frequently express how safe and refreshing it is to interact with people that &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo;.
What sets your community apart from others?
 In a general sense, the stopdrinking community is unlike many subreddit-based communities due to the care members have for each other.</description>

      <description>/r/bodyweightfitness is a place for all people to find quality discussion about training using your bodyweight as resistance. Though our focus is on bodyweight, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to discuss any and all training modalities. In order to keep the standard of discussion high, help out newbies, we have a FAQ that is required reading. We also expect you to have put some effort into finding an answer to your questions. /r/bodyweightfitness&#39; userbase is &amp;ldquo;awesome combination of no-nonsense jerks and really friendly people, both of whom generally seem to know what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about&amp;rdquo;. People from all training modalities and levels visit and contribute to the sub. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a the father of two who can&amp;rsquo;t do a single chinup and wants to learn how to do one, or a teenager who is banging out one-armers all day every day and wants advice on how to get to the next level, all are welcome.
We have weekly threads dedicated to moronic questions, members&#39; own routines, learning about training theory, learning about exercise technique, form checks, slip ups and fails in training, and personal achievements. Then we also have a monthly feedback thread where users can give suggestions and feedback on the moderators actions. Alongside this we have an extensive wiki with exercise progressions, bodyweight training info, and much, much more. On top of all of this we have regular AMAs with notable people who have a lot of experience with bodyweight training, like Ninja Warrior contestants, high level gymnastics coaches, and many, many more. Finally, we also occassionally organize challenge months, where we all focus on a single exercise progression, and try to improve our abilities in that. With the support of some of our most knowledgeable users, these are always a huge success.

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community?
We&amp;rsquo;re a group of like-minded dedicated Minecraft players who love to engage in casual gameplay and discussion. The more the merrier.
What sets your community apart from others?
We&amp;rsquo;re one of the few Minecraft servers out there that really try hard to maintain that old-school feeling of community. You may watch YouTubers play on servers like Mindcrack and Hermitcraft and wish you could play on such a rich and inviting server, but they&amp;rsquo;re both very locked down. Well, wish no longer!
What is your goal with this community?
To make sure everyone has fun playing a game that they love.
What is your community (in)famous for?
Selfie threads.
What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?
Currently it is this post titled &amp;ldquo;Bull. Shit.&amp;rdquo;
What have you learned from being a part of this community?
That if you build it - they will come.
Does your community have any traditions or special events?
Right now we&amp;rsquo;ve only done it once, but we had a Christmas in July event this year. I hope it can continue on as a tradition.
Every few weeks we host a UHC match (Ultra Hardcore survival) on the weekend. That&amp;rsquo;s always a ton of fun.
Does your community have any associated social media or websites? (facebook/twitter/instagram/etc)
None other than reddit/IRC</description>

      <description>Can you give us a description of your community?
 The goal of /r/Games is to provide a place for informative and interesting gaming content and discussions. The quick list of rules can be found in the sidebar of the subreddit, and there is a full rules page for more information.  What inspired this community?
 There were a few mods in /r/gaming that saw a split in the community between people who wanted lighter, quicker, more humor focused content and others who wanted more detailed discussion and informative submissions. We created /r/games to focus on the latter of those two groups.  What sets your community apart from others?
 We allow a broad range of content while also having fairly strict rules in place to eliminate a lot of the low effort types of content. We also do fairly strict moderation inside the comments to keep discussion on topic.  What is your goal with this community?
 To encourage quality discussion and informative posts for a broad gaming community.  What is your community (in)famous for?
 Being a more heavily moderated subreddit that is willing to remove popular submissions or comments if they violate the rules.  What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?
 The highest scoring post of all time in the subreddit is: Buying a PS4 game on your smartphone causes your PS4 to wake up, download the game and go back to sleep. It is not necessarily the best representation of the subreddit though due to the fact that posts that are short and not controversial tend to be the most upvoted but not lend themselves to the best discussion.  Do you have any favorite quotes or posts from your users?
 Not really - I tend to like the discussion and analysis more, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t really lend itself to singling out a particular quote or post.  What do you hope your community gains from this subreddit?
 A place to learn about, discuss, and share insights about games and the surrounding community.  What have you learned from being a part of this community?
 That there is no shortage of people who are willing to criticize and praise every decision that is made, no matter how insignificant. Also, I am constantly surprised with how dedicated certain individuals in the community are for collecting and presenting information.</description>

      <description> /r/Anxiety is a supportive community for all things anxiety related. Rules can be found on the sidebar however a brief rundown would be: As a supportive community we take racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or just generally offensive messages seriously and therefore posts or replies with such will be removed. Contact the moderators if you disagree with a message or post being removed. When asking a specific question, it would helpful if you provide your general info(age, gender, type of anxiety, trigger examples, medications (if any), country, no insurance, etc.)
As a rule of thumb: If your anxiety is interfering with how you want to live your everyday life, if it is preventing you from doing things you want to do, or if you now run your life around your anxiety, you should get an evaluation and consider therapy.
We are not psychiatrists or psychologists, and we cannot diagnose you or give medical advice, we can only share our own experiences.
Please no advertising of &amp;ldquo;quick fix&amp;rdquo; products/ideas. If you are wanting to post about something that may be viewed as such message the moderators to run it by beforehand.
