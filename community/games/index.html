            <p><strong>Can you give us a description of your community?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The goal of 

    <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Games">/r/Games</a> is to provide a place for informative and interesting gaming content and discussions. The quick list of rules can be found in the sidebar of the subreddit, and there is a full rules page for more information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What inspired this community?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There were a few mods in 

    <a href="https://reddit.com/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a> that saw a split in the community between people who wanted lighter, quicker, more humor focused content and others who wanted more detailed discussion and informative submissions. We created 

    <a href="https://reddit.com/r/games">/r/games</a> to focus on the latter of those two groups.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What sets your community apart from others?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We allow a broad range of content while also having fairly strict rules in place to eliminate a lot of the low effort types of content. We also do fairly strict moderation inside the comments to keep discussion on topic.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is your goal with this community?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>To encourage quality discussion and informative posts for a broad gaming community.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is your community (in)famous for?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Being a more heavily moderated subreddit that is willing to remove popular submissions or comments if they violate the rules.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The highest scoring post of all time in the subreddit is: Buying a PS4 game on your smartphone causes your PS4 to wake up, download the game and go back to sleep. It is not necessarily the best representation of the subreddit though due to the fact that posts that are short and not controversial tend to be the most upvoted but not lend themselves to the best discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Do you have any favorite quotes or posts from your users?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Not really - I tend to like the discussion and analysis more, which doesn&rsquo;t really lend itself to singling out a particular quote or post.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do you hope your community gains from this subreddit?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A place to learn about, discuss, and share insights about games and the surrounding community.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What have you learned from being a part of this community?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>That there is no shortage of people who are willing to criticize and praise every decision that is made, no matter how insignificant. Also, I am constantly surprised with how dedicated certain individuals in the community are for collecting and presenting information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Does your community have any traditions or special events?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We have regular official discussion threads that range from individual games to music to mechanics, and where possible we will have official live threads of major events (E3, steam announcements, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Does your community have any associated social media or websites? (facebook/twitter/instagram/etc)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Not currently, other than the IRC channel. We do have a few users who are semi-official &ldquo;/r/Games reporters&rdquo; who will cover certain gaming events in person when they are able to, but that is more of a loose group of (remarkably dedicated) volunteers.</li>
</ul>
