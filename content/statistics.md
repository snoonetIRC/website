**Statistics will be shutdown on Thursday, May 24th until a suitable replacement has been created.**

In anticipation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into effect on May 25, 2018, Statistics will no longer be offered as a network service. All data collected by the bot will be erased. We will be working on a GDPR-compatible option but have no planned release at this time.

Our current plans are to develop the replacement at this github repo: https://github.com/snoonetIRC/StatsBot
