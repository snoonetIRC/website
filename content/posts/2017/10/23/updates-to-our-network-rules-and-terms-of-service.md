## From: Snoonet Management

We've refreshed our [Network Rules](/rules) and updated our [Terms of Service](/tos) to make things easier to understand. These changes will go into effect as Monday, October 23rd, 2017 at 05:00 GMT. Your continued use of Snoonet after this date and time will constitute your acceptance of these changes.

## Important to know
* We've not made any major changes to our rules for some time. In fact, the only major changes we've made are to update some of the information as certain pieces were out of date. We've also moved certain items to different categories to make an easier read. You will now easily be able to find what you are looking for.
* Our Terms of Service have been updated to include that we run an Open Proxy Monitor on our network. This information has previously been communicated in our MOTD, shown to all users when they connect to Snoonet.
* Our Terms of Service have been updated to include how we protect our users from abuse.

If you have any questions, we encourage you to join [#snoonet](https://webchat.snoonet.org/snoonet) and ask your question there.

Thanks for using Snoonet!
