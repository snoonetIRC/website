# Network Conduct

- Solicitation of services to earn financial gain is only permitted by asking the channel operators.
- No user is to request money from others. While we understand many are in times of need, please register a gofundme account and state why you are asking for money. Please ask permission from the channel operators. Begging, and contacting multiple users requesting money is a network offense and will be dealt with warnings and removal from the network.


# Channel Rules

- Channels may be freely registered on Snoonet, however if subreddit moderators claim an already-registered channel with the same name as their subreddit it shall be granted upon request.
- Communities that have existed on Snoonet for a long period of time will be granted special exemptions. To prevent hostile takeovers of channels, Snoonet operations staff will work with the entire mod team of the subreddit to find the best solution.
