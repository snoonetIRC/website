Today, Snoonet is pleased to announce our newest partner - Private Internet Access!

Owned by London Trust Media, Private Internet Access is a provider of consumer VPN services. Their sponsorship couldn’t come at a better time as Snoonet continues to grow and develop new, innovative things for its communities!

Private Internet Access have generously donated $25,000 to Snoonet to assist with community building efforts. In addition, they have provided us with 11 new servers which will be equally dispersed among our geographic profile as needed. We are extremely grateful to them for this as it’ll allow us to focus on bigger and better things as we finish up with 2016 and head in to 2017!

To celebrate this new, exciting partnership, Private Internet Access would like to give away 5,000 accounts with a free 1-year subscription to the service. These are available on a first come, first serve basis and Snoonet will initially be giving out only 500. If you'd like one, fill out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ot_vyJ5ak77X_qSCsQupPmUpcNe9x3hpGd7aXAGiSUA/viewform?ts=5852bf5a&edit_requested=true">request form</a>.
