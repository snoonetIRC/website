# Email Support

We have set up an e-mail for those in need of support if they are having connection issues, or need any type of support outside of the chat network. Any suggestions or requests for any thing Snoonet are **highly encouraged** as well. This can be done by contacting us at **support@snoonet.org** - Be sure to include your nickname in the e-mail!


# Keeping in Touch


We will be announcing things as we work on them via wallops (/mode yournick +w) for those interested, and discussing things in #snoonet - Recently we changed the default connect mode so users may opt in to these messages, rather than having to opt-out for things they are not concerned with.


# Webchat


Snooonet webchat will be greatly updated. Much more stable and integrated more with the reddit lifestyle you know and love. It should be easier for everybody to use. We have made sure that all your existing webchat links will still work as normal so no need to worry about that.

This will now pave the way for subreddit mods to embed or customize Snoonet webchat for their own communities. You may link to your IRC channel (chat room) with `http://webchat.snoonet.org/yourchannelhere`


# SSL/Fingerprint Information

Due to recent changes in the Snoonet network infrastructure, our servers now use a single, self-signed certificate for all secure (SSL) connections. For our security-conscious clients, the below fingerprints may be used to verify the identity of a Snoonet server:

`99:5B:AC:FE:E6:A4:22:8F:51:2D:21:63:4B:5F:05:4D:E1:61:8D:6B`

The reason for self-signing is to offer encryption and security for those who seek it while handle issues with our paid/valid certificate to work with the IRCds. Our staff has been working very hard to **make things the way the need to be** after the unfortunate events with the .com to .org address change.
