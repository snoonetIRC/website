On Monday, Jan. 7 at 2AM EST we will be issuing updates to the Snoonet IRCd servers.

There will be some brief splits as we upgrade the operating systems on two of the nodes. We will be adding more nodes for clients to connect to for both IPv4 and IPv6. As our webchat reaches a more capable stage, these updates will be to prepare for the widespread user count anticipated by newcomers from Reddit Enhancement Suite/Reddit links.


We will keep services downtime to a minimum, anticipating very little downtime.


Snoonet is working on other projects aside from IRC/live chat services, and more news will be shared as the days come.


We are also seeking client servers. We have plenty of servers, but we feel as if they will be of use in the very near future. If you can help, please e-mail Shane@snoonet.org and we will continue from there. Please have advanced knowledge and experience moderating large communities!


Snoonet is here for ALL communities, reddit and otherwise. If you'd like to help us provide for the communities, shoot us an e-mail!

If you have any concerns/questions, feel free to post at http://snoonet.reddit.com / e-mail us at support@snoonet.org / ask us in #help


Sincerely,
Snoonet Staff
