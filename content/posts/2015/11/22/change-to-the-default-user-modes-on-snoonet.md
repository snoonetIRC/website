title: Change to the Default User Modes on Snoonet
type: post
---

We know that many communities are concerned about privacy for their users.  To that end, in addition to masking user's IPs, we are now setting +I as a default usermode. 

## What does this mean?

Unless you /umode -I, users will now be unable to see channels that you are in.  If you wish -I to persist, please type /msg nickserv keepmodes on

## Looking for new channels?

If you are looking to find new channels, please visit https://snoonet.org/communities.  

If you'd like your channel to be added to this list, please ask in [#help](https://webchat.snoonet.org/help) or submit a ticket [here](https://support.snoonet.org).
