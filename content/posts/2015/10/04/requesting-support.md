Going forward, please submit all support requests, including [network ban appeals](/banappeal), through our [support system](http://support.snoonet.org).  

The support system will allow us to track and respond to issues and inquiries in a more efficient and effective manner.

If you require immediate assistance and are not currently banned from the network, Snoonet staff will be happy to assist you in the IRC #help channel.  Please keep in mind that you may be redirected back to the support system to create a request due to the nature of your request.
