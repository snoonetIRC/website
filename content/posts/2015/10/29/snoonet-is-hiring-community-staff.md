title: "Snoonet is hiring community staff!"

Snoonet is looking to hire community staff members.  Applicants should be active and engaged in our IRC communities and be interested in volunteering their time to make the network a better place.   

## Responsibilities 

Community staff will assist with various projects designed to improve the user experience on Snoonet.  They will be expected to consult with communities, specifically with an eye to understanding community needs and suggesting tools and policies that should be developed to assist with community moderation and growth.   

On a day-to-day basis, responsibilities will also include assisting with support requests in #help and in our ticket system, drafting communications about upcoming events or ongoing issues, and generally providing users and channel operators with support and assistance.   

## Qualifications 

We are primarily looking for people with ideas, energy, and a willingness to contribute to the community.  Community staff WILL be network operators, and as such, we are looking for people with knowledge of basic IRC commands, including how to set up channels and assist others in that respect.   

We are NOT looking for operators who are solely interested in providing network support at this point in time.  Applicants should be interested in working with communities and demonstrate the motivation, creativity, and initiative necessary to succeed on a volunteer team. 

## Applications and Inquiries 

If you are interested in applying, please visit [Volunteer Application](/volunteer-recruitment) and send an application to [apply@snoonet.org](mailto:apply@snoonet.org).  

If you have any questions about our community team or our work, please feel free to PM Ari or ScarletAngel.
