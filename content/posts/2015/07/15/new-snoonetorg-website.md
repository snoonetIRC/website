We are excited to announce that the new Snoonet.org website is live.  The new website features a more modern design and includes embedded Kiwi webchat at [https://snoonet.org/webchat](/webchat).  Accessing webchat through our website will allow users easier access to pages like our network rules, channel statistics, and help documentation while chatting.  

Feedback on the new site and suggestions for the future can be provided in our #snoonet channel.  We recommend tagging Diss, as our new website exists mostly thanks to his [hard work](https://i.imgur.com/Te0WuIB.jpg)!
