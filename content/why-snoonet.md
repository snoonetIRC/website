## Snoonet is a network run by redditors, for redditors.

* Thousands of redditors and hundreds of subreddits already use Snoonet every day.
* Snoonet provides better security and support because of our focus on reddit
  users and reddit communities.

  there's a reddit-related channel for you.

## Snoonet protects your privacy

* IPs and registration information are visible only to yourself and Snoonet
  Staff.
* User channels are hidden from their WHOIS - Other users cannot view what
  channels you are in unless you explicitly allow it.
* Private messages can be restricted to only users you want to message you

For more information, please see our [Privacy and Security page](/privacy).

  stays connected 24/7.

## Snoonet offers custom services and policies catered to reddit and unique to our network.

* Channel bots created specifically for redditors, which any channel op can
  `/invite`.
  - SubWatch - automatically posts subreddit threads, is able to watch private
    subreddits and announce threads based on keywords in the title.
  - gonzobot - a customized Cloudbot implementation for the communities on
    Snoonet.
* Priority enforcement for reddit nicks and channels. Mods of corresponding
  subreddits get preference for IRC channels, and unlike on Freenode and other
  networks, you no longer have to use the #reddit-channelname format.
  Additionally, If you own a username on reddit, you will be able to use the
  corresponding nickname on Snoonet.
* Custom webchat built in cooperation with Snoonet, and simple, short-form
  channel links ({{< webchat_plain >}}/channelname).
