Hi, I'm Greenish and frankly I'm on IRC too much for my own good — guess that’s how I got this gig, though.

If I'm not skulking about the network I'm probably studying, fighting the urge to buy some stupid old hardware that no one cares about to do even stupider things with, or suffering the effects of temporary self-inflicted sanity loss due to the previously mentioned activities.
