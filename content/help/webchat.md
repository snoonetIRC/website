The absolute easiest way to connect to Snoonet is by using our webchat. Many subreddits you may have heard of Snoonet from will provide direct links to the chat. Our webchat uses the KiwiIRC client. To connect to Snoonet webchat simply visit {{< webchat title="the webchat" >}} and choose a nickname.

The webchat can be used anywhere, at work, at home, or on mobile. This simplicity comes with the drawback of a few less features than a desktop client. A desktop client is customizable and has more functions. If you want to use a desktop client just read the next section. If you have problems setting up the desktop client you can always go back to the webchat, it's just a click away.

To get started, enter a nickname for yourself and the channel that you wish to enter. Select ``start`` and you're connected to Snoonet!

To see a list of the communities on Snoonet, type ``/list`` into the chat area. When you find a community you are interested in, simply click on the name of the chat and it adds a tab at the top of the page for you. You can switch between chats using these tabs.

To register your nickname so that you can return and use the same nickname without worrying that someone else will steal it, make sure you are using the nickname you want to register and type ``/msg nickserv REGISTER <password> <email>``. You do not need to include the brackets. Make sure to use a real email, because we will send your verification to that email and you will lose the nickname if you do not submit your code. When your registration is successful, upon returning to chat, you'll need to select the box that says you have a password, and enter your password there.
