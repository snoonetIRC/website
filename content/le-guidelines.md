These guidelines provide U.S. law enforcement with information about Snoonet, its business and user records, and the legal process required to compel Snoonet to produce information regarding Snoonet users in the course of criminal and civil investigations.

This guide is for informational purposes only. It is not a commitment by Snoonet to take specific action in a given circumstance and creates no contractual obligation.

Snoonet takes the privacy of its users seriously. Snoonet therefore insists on compliance with procedural requirements, scrutinizes requests and legal process for facial validity and legal sufficiency, and objects to legal process, when appropriate. Although Snoonet provides these guidelines, Snoonet does not waive and expressly reserves all available rights and objections and your compliance with these guidelines does not necessarily equate with compliance with the relevant legal requirements.

# <a name="preserve">How do I make a preservation request?</a>
*<a href="#top">^back ^to ^top</a>*

We do not retain data for law enforcement purposes unless we receive a valid preservation request before a user has deleted that content from our platform or before the Preservation Period expires.

Consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 2703(f), Snoonet will preserve records for up to 90 days pending issuance of legal process if it receives a written preservation request in the form noted below:

1.	Signed by the requesting official;
2.	Include the Snoonet user name;
3.	Identify the records to be preserved;
4.	Identify the time period for which records are to be preserved (maximum 90 days);
5.	Confirm that valid legal process is forthcoming;
6.	Have a valid return official email address; and
7.	Be sent on law enforcement letterhead to lawenforcement [at] snoonet.org with the subject line reading "Preservation Request – User: [insert relevant username here]".

Unless Snoonet receives an additional preservation request, Snoonet will, after 90 days, release the preservation and the preserved records will be subject to Snoonet's normal retention or destruction schedules.

Will users be notified of a preservation request on their user account?

No. However, users will be notified of any subsequent legal process that is not accompanied by a valid non-disclosure order issued by the court.

# <a name="account-information">Requests for Snoonet Account Information</a>
*<a href="#top">^back ^to ^top</a>*

Requests for user account information from law enforcement must be directed to Snoonet.

Snoonet reviews legal process to ensure facial validity and legal sufficiency under applicable laws and regulations, such as the federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701.

All legal process and requests for user information must be:

• narrowly tailored,

• specifically identify the account/user at issue, and

• specifically identify the information sought (e.g. connection information) which cannot otherwise be obtained online.

Snoonet cannot respond to invalid, overbroad, or vague requests. Snoonet also reviews all legal process and requests to ensure they are not objectionable for other reasons, such as requests that seek confidential or proprietary information, privileged information, or information protected from disclosure under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Will users be notified of a request for information on their user account?

Yes, unless Snoonet is prohibited from doing so by statute or a valid court order, Snoonet's policy is to provide notice of requests and legal process seeking a subscriber's information to that subscriber. Snoonet will generally give the user a reasonable period of time to file an objection to production before producing responsive records. Where a statute or court order prohibits notice for a limited time period, Snoonet provides notice upon expiration of that period.

In emergency or exigent circumstances, Snoonet may exercise its discretion not to provide a user with notice of a request for their account information prior to production to law enforcement. However, Snoonet reserves the right to provide notice to affected users after production has occurred.

Production of Records

We provide responsive records in electronic format. In accordance with 18 U.S.C. §2706, reimbursement for the costs associated with production may be requested.

Witness Testimony

Snoonet does not provide expert witness testimony and does not have witnesses on call who are available to testify.

*<a href="#top">^back ^to ^top</a>*

Snoonet evaluates these requests on a case-by-case basis and may request additional information to verify the nature of the request and  the requestor's identity. It does not commit to producing records under any set of circumstances or within a particular timeline. To seek to compel Snoonet to produce information, please obtain and personally serve valid and sufficient legal process.

Will users be notified of an emergency request on their user account?

Snoonet may exercise its discretion to delay notice to users when emergency disclosure requests are received.
