## Network-Wide Rules

+ Repeated and/or intentional ban evasion may earn you a timed network ban. To request a ban appeal, follow the policy of appeals (where one exists) or message the banning OP. Bans from Snoonet network channels or the Snoonet IRC network in its entirety must be addressed via [support ticket](https://support.snoonet.org).
+ Please respect your fellow users. Do not intentionally harass other users. This includes “trolling”. Action may be taken on a channel-to-channel basis, where such rules exist. If harassment is persistent, across multiple channels or targets a specific user for a length of time, the offending user may be banned.
+ Get along with others! We understand that there are multiple types of humor, but do not excessively attack any other user on this network. Please note that sarcasm doesn't translate well over IRC.
+ Posting the personal information of others is grounds for a permanent network ban. Attempting to collect personal info of users is dealt with in the same manner.
+ No solicitation. This includes, but is not limited to, public spam, private message spam, repeated solicitation of services, solicitation of other network channels, and vote brigading on social media (eg. encouraging others to upvote/downvote a thread on reddit).
+ Solicitation of services for financial gain is only permitted by asking the channel operators.
+ No user is to request money from others. While we understand many are in times of need, please register a gofundme account and state why you are asking for money. Please ask permission from the channel operators. Begging, and contacting multiple users requesting money is a network offense and will be dealt with warnings and removal from the network.
+ Listen to network staff. They can be identified by the “snoonet/rank/nickname” hostmask. /whois NICKNAME to confirm that they are a Snoonet staff member. You can view the staff directory [here](http://snoonet.org/staff)
+ Consider against ignoring network operators and consider against ignoring channel operators. If you have an issue with the conduct of a network operator, kindly modmail [/r/Snoonet](https://reddit.com/r/snoonet/) or message a [Snoonet Manager](https://snoonet.org/staff) on IRC and your complaint will be noted and addressed.
+ User impersonation is prohibited. If you're found to be intentionally impersonating Snoonet users, you may face removal from the network for a length of time to be decided at the time of incident.

## For Your Information

+ Please don't spam/flood the network. If you need to paste a large chunk of text, consider https://paste.snoonet.org/ or https://pastebin.com/. Automated tools are in use that have the capability of accidentally banning innocent flooders.
+ If a channel is getting spammed and no operators are around, or if you just need help with something network-related, join [#help](http://webchat.snoonet.org/help).
