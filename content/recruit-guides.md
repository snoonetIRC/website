# From: Snoonet Management

Snoonet is looking to recruit volunteers for the Community Guide position.

We need helpers that will be available to answer questions about Snoonet and [orangechat](https://orangechat.io) in #help and in #orangechat.

Community Guides will be responsible for guiding Snoonet users with any help requests.

## What is orangechat?

Orangechat is a webchat that integrates directly with reddit.com. You can use your reddit account to connect directly to chatrooms and chat with other users browsing your favorite subreddits.

- Orangechat will bring new communities to Snoonet in the form of an easy-to-access interface directly from reddit.com.
- Orangechat allows existing Snoonet communities to link their subreddit's to Snoonet via orangechat so no one is left out.

## What we need:
- Age 18+
- Be active!
- Regular Snoonet user with a NickServ account age of at least 6 months (180 days).
- Experience using IRC commands from a channel op and user perspective.
