Good news everyone!

Network operations has moved mail to a Selfhosted Exchange server.

The website to login is:  https://exchange.snoonet.org/owa

Our server allows Exchange Activesync for syncing with Apple, Android, Outlook desktop clients, and Apple mail when setup with exchange. Exchange also allows shared calendars for notifications about absences, scheduling network events, twitter, etc.

POP3 and POP3S will be tweaked after rollout, as well as IMAP and IMAPS, on standard ports will be available.

Support and various other community mailboxes are setup as Shared mailboxes. In Outlook web access, right click on your nick on the left side and click Open Other User's Mailbox. Enter support as the mailbox, or whatever additional mailboxes you have been assigned to.

All staff have access to the support mailbox, with various staff assigned to other shared mailboxes. You will be notified of what you are assigned to.

All staff also has access to the catchall mailbox, named catchall.  Catchall is generally used for users who mistype support, etc (suport@ for example).

To enable sending from other mailboxes (Replying as Snoonet Support instead of your personal email), click options, and See All Options, Click Settings, under Message Format, click Always show From field. When replying to Support email, delete what is in the from field and replace with support.

If you are working on a snoonet specific project with either network or channel staff, and feel as if they may benefit from a snoonet.org mailbox, or access to a shared folder, please notify operations by @operations.

If you would like a custom email address, Your first name or alternative prefix to @snoonet.org, please also @operations and we can set it up for you.
