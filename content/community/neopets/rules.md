Welcome to the [##neopets](Webchat.snoonet.org/##neopets) IRC channel!

This is a place for Neopians to discuss things. Have fun, relax, join in the conversations, or start your own conversation. There are some rules that you will need to abide by, in addition to the general [Snoonet Rules](/rules):

* No racism, homophobia, transphobia, harassment, or [bigotry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry) of any kind.
* Don't be a dick. The Channel OPs reserve the right to interpret dickishness.
* No flooding or spamming the channel.
* Do not ask for personal information.
* Do not post personal information of others. This is grounds for a network ban.
* Mark all NSFW or NSFL links as such. If you can't open it in front of a church, it needs to be marked.
* Respect your fellow users. No harassment or trolling of any kind.
* If you want to talk dirty, send nudes, or use bigoted language: do it in PM.
* If you want to argue about the channel rules, do it in PM.

Multiple warnings will result in removal from the channel or a ban. All kicks/removals/bans are at the discretion of the channel OPs.

If you have any issues with a user in the channel or need help you can type the name of an OP to get their attention, or you can /msg opsname message.
