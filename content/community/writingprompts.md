I'm [/u/SurvivorType](http://www.reddit.com/user/survivortype), Co-Lead Moderator of [/r/WritingPrompts](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/) along with our founder [/u/RyanKinder](http://www.reddit.com/user/RyanKinder).

We are a subreddit and chat room dedicated to inspiring people to write! Find a prompt that moves you and respond with a story or a poem.

When I created my reddit account, the sub had around 235 subscribers. That seems like a long time ago now.  Since then, we have become a default subreddit with nearly 2.5 million subscribers. That is quite a change.

One thing that has never changed is our commitment to getting people writing. That is what sets us apart from other communities. We don't ask that you be polished. We don't ask that you be published. All we ask is that you get writing. As long as you are willing to try, we want everyone to get involved.

There have been a number of incredible films and narrations created based on prompts and stories. You can find them in our [wiki.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/multimedia)

We also have a showcase for subscriber favorites at [/r/bestofWritingPrompts](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestofWritingPrompts/) where you can read some of the best content the subreddit has to offer. Anyone can post a story that would like to help an author get recognition on a prompt response.

We hold many contests throughout the year, culminating on our annual novelette contest. Reading the entries and seeing some of the talent demonstrated is an amazing experience.

Our [chat room](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/writingprompts) is a great place to come for both idle chit chat as well as ask for a critique on your writing. It's a warm and welcoming environment where we offer plenty of help and encouragement in your writing endeavors. Discussions can range anywhere from gaming to subreddit policy, and everything in between. Usually it's utter seething madness though. We kinda like it that way.

We hold word sprints in which we see who can write the most words in a set period of time on whatever story they happen to be working on. There is also a side project called Writer’s Tabletop™ Fantasy RPG which is a role playing game, now hosted in [#wtfrpg](http://webchat.snoonet.org/wtfrpg).

Our main chat room is always open, so [drop by](http://webchat.snoonet.org/writingprompts) and say hello. We hope to see you there!
