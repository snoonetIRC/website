# Can you give us a description of your community: what it's about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?

The 100daysofketo community is directly linked to our subreddit: {{< subreddit_link 100daysofketo >}}. It was started as a support community for people who are on the keto diet who wanted to commit to 100 days of keto eating. Every 100 days (or so), we start a new round with goal setting, and continue through the 100 days with various challenges and events to keep people motivated to succeed!

**Our only rule is don't be an asshole!**

# What inspired this community?

Starting and sticking with a new diet is hard! Especially when it is as restrictive as keto can be sometimes. I know that when I started I felt really overwhelmed. Sometimes, even waiting 10 minutes for a response on a Reddit post was too long to wait and I had fallen off the wagon due to a misunderstanding or over-emotional problem. We started our online community as a way to provide immediate feedback and support and also to foster a more face-to-face interactive community for our users.

# What sets your community apart from others?

Compared to the other keto communities, we are less about the science and technical aspects and more about the day-in day-out nitty gritty of sticking to the diet. Our channel serves as another line of support for those days when you need assistance and just want to talk to someone who's experiencing the same problems that you may be having. We're all here to help each other!

# What have you learned from being a part of this community?

Our community and our participants are awesome! We have people participating in our challenges from all over the world and all walks of life. Keto is such an amazing tool for so many people and it's amazing to be a part of their success. Inspiring others has also made me a much more positive person.

# Does your community have any traditions or special events?

We have themed weekly threads that help keep the 100 days interesting, like Motivational Monday, Workout Wednesday, and Food Friday! We are very user-centric, so if you have a great idea for a new tradition, let us know!!
