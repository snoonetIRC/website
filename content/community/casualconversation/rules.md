## [#casualconversation](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/casualconversation)
**Looking for live conversation?** Share a story, ask a question, or start a conversation about anything you desire in our [irc channel](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/casualconversation). Maybe you'll make some friends in the process.

### Starter Commands 
*If you are new to IRC, here are a few starter commands*—  

To change your name from a Snooname: `/nick username`
    
Set auto-join: `/msg NickServ AJOIN ADD #casualconversation`

Send someone a PM:  `/query username`

Tag or ping someone `type the first few letters of their nickname and hit tab`

And when you're feelin' comfy, we recommend registering your name: `/msg NickServ REGISTER password email`

→ *See [IRC Prelude](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/new2irc.html) & [Snoonet's Help & Guidelines](https://www.snoonet.org/help) for more.*

### Rules
Be what you want other people to be. Like on the {{< subreddit_link casualconversation >}}, when in the channel you should aim to be as polite as possible. This makes others feel welcome and conversations can take place without users being rude to one another.

* **Respect others.**  

Remember—you're speaking with humans.


*  **Don't take things too seriously.**  

Keep it casual. We are all here to have a nice time chatting it up so let's all just have a good time.


*Warning(s) will be given for…*  

* Posting NSFW links and excessive immature sexual discussion
* Flooding and spamming the channel
* Abusing the bots
* Advertising and self-promotion
* Posting memes
* Discussing subreddit drama
* & Any other behavior that holds up the general conversation

Kicks are stern warnings. Multiple warnings or kicks will result in a ban at the discretion of the channel Ops.
