Hi, {{< webchat channel="#socialskills" title="#socialskills" >}} is an irc channel hosted on snoonet for those looking to have friendly conversation and/or receive advice in regards to social relationships. Keep in mind  that we are not professionals. For advice and help with mental health troubles #depression and #anxiety are better. Hope to see you there!

In addition to the general [Snoonet Rules](/rules) you will need to abide by the following channel rules:

* Above all else, being socially awkward is ok, being mean is not
* Be respectful of others
* Keep in mind some of the people here are socially awkward, be patient with them
* Bringing drama from another channel is not allowed
* Circlejerks about how much you dislike someone in the chat are not allowed, you will be kicked/banned if you are seen participating in one
* Trolling and troll advice on socializing will result in punishment
* If you feel any of these rules have been broken please pm GhostyOne or one of the other OPs
* Have fun!

Multiple warnings will result in removal from the channel or a ban. All kicks/removals/bans are at the discretion of the channel OPs.

If you have any issues with a user in the channel or need help you can type the name of an OP to get their attention, or you can /msg opsname message.
