**Can you give us a description of your community: what it's about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?**

* Hi, we're the #BadSubHub, otherwise known as the de facto /r/badhistory IRC channel (although anyone else on the badacademic subreddits are encouraged to come visit).

/r/badhistory is the place where you can see bad history get taken down, in many cases with great aplomb. It's /r/AskHistorians at the pub, where we're all raging drunk and swearing like sailors.

We're also part of the general /r/BadSubHub academy, which also includes subs like /r/badscience, /r/badlinguistics, /r/badlegaladvice, and /r/bad_religion. If there's a discipline, there's probably a badacademia subreddit for you to submit to.

The rest of the post will be dealing with /r/badhistory specifically, as most users in the IRC are /r/badhistory users.


**What inspired this community?**

* It all started a long time ago, when one user decided that we need a sub to feature the large amounts of bad history found all over Reddit. Since then, we've grown to be the largest badacademia sub, complete with injokes and Nazi moderators all on our own.


**What sets your community apart from others?**

* /r/badhistory is known for Rule 5, or the "explain why your submission is bad history" rule. It's the reason why the subreddit hasn't completely descended into mindless circlejerking (although we do still jerk) and the reason why many people are attracted to the subreddit.


**What is your goal with this community?**

* Our goal is to debunk and discuss bad history that shows up, whether it's from an article, a Reddit comment, a blog post, a TV show, a porno (yes, really), a comic, a commercial, etc.


**What is your community (in)famous for?**

* We're known for, and in no particular order, our R5, our injokes, our devotion to Volcano, our fascist-communist-theist-Whig-drunk-SJW-pinko-statist-reactionary moderation team, and for being literally SRS (see /r/badhistory/wiki/accusations)


**What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?**

* [A PSA: Do not trust heavily upvoted responses in AskHistorians just because they are upvoted and gilded.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2jhhje/a_psa_do_not_trust_heavily_upvoted_responses_in/)


**Do you have any favorite quotes or posts from your users?**

* We recently did a /r/bestof2014 contest, found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qhre5/the_bad_history_best_of_awards_results/). Here, you can find what our subreddit considered our greatest hits in 2014.


**What do you hope your community gains from this subreddit?**

* We hope that our users leave with a better understanding of common (and uncommon) bad historical tropes and why they're wrong.


**What have you learned from being a part of this community?**

* Good history (I hope!).


**Does your community have any traditions or special events?**

* We have a Mindless Monday and a Thoughts for Thursday megathread every week, and we have a moratorium every month, where the users get to choose what topics they don't want to have to read about for the next month.


**Does your community have any associated social media or websites? (facebook/twitter/instagram/etc)**

* Nope!
