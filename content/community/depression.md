**<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide or self-harm, please reach out to any of the [crisis resources](#resources) listed below as opposed to using #depression.</span>**

We are a peer support community aimed primarily at helping those struggling with depression. This page contains resources to aid those suffering from depression or its related ailments. Please consult these resources if you feel that you need assistance beyond peer help.

One of the most helpful things we can do for one another is listen. As fellow human beings, we understand that life gets difficult. Sometimes, the thing that we need most of all when we are feeling overwhelmed or depressed is a listening ear. When times get tough, we will be here.

## What exactly can we do? {#purpose}

Our main function is to listen, be here for one another and offer peer support. Whether you’re just having a bad day, issues that are bringing you down, or currently suffering from one of the many variations of depression, we are here for you.

Please understand that although we are here to provide peer support, our channel is not intended as a replacement for counselling from a qualified professional and as such, all information/advice provided by our users is to be considered anecdotal and does not carry any weight. Please note, **we are not affiliated with [/r/depression](https://reddit.com/r/depression)** – that said, they are a wonderful group and we encourage you to check them out.

## Introducing #depression-offtopic {#casual}
As of December 19th, 2018, we're happy to launch a new sister channel called #depression-offtopic. The purpose of this new channel is to allow our user base to engage in casual and/or idle chatter while allowing the main channel to remain for on-topic discussions, as necessary.

To access this channel, please {{< webchat channel="#depression-offtopic" title="click here" >}}.

We ask all users to follow the same rule set for #depression, with the exception being that as chat will generally flow more quickly in a casual chat channel, users should avoid using the channel if they are easily overwhelmed by a fast-paced chat.

## Channel Ban Appeals {#appeals}
If you've recently been banned from one of our channels or have been instructed to read this section, please understand:

- We prohibit ban evasion, which is [against Snoonet rules](/rules).
- As it is important enough to list twice, ban evasion *for any reason* is prohibited and may result in a network ban.
- Our staff make every effort to keep banning users to an absolute minimum.


Before you appeal your channel ban, it's important to understand why you've been banned from the channel. If you do not know why you were banned, please *message one of the [channel operators](#ops)*. Lastly, take a moment to review and familiarize yourself with our [rules](#rules) before appealing your ban.

##  General Information on Depression {#info}

### Depressive Disorders (the big two)

#### Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)

Severe symptoms that interfere with one's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy life. As episode can occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often the person has several episodes. This can be caused from outside influences (life crap) or a chemical makeup thing. If you suspect this is what is going on I implore you please call your doctor and talk with them. You can get help, it can get better, but only if you take the steps in the right direction!

#### Persistent Depressive Disorder

Depressed mood lasting at least two years or longer. Those diagnosed with PDD can have bouts of MDD alongside the PDD, but the main point is that the symptoms must last for at least 2 years.
