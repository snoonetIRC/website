## <h2><a name="#purpose">Purpose</a></h2>
#depression-alt provides a space away from #depression where the rules are relaxed. Certain topics normally prohibited in the main channel will be permitted here, meaning that discretion is advised.

If you can not handle discussion of self harm and/or more specific suicide methods, it is advised to immediately /part or /leave the channel. Network and channel rules still apply. Please see below for more information.

## <a name="#ops">Channel Operators</a>
The team handling #depression-alt is the same team that currently handles the #depression channel.

If you need to contact an operator for assistance, you may find a list of operators by [clicking here](https://www.snoonet.org/depression#ops).
