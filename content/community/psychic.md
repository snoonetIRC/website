**Can you give us a description of your community: what it's about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?**

#Psychic is the official chatroom for {{< subreddit_link Psychic>}}, the largest reddit community for psychics, intuitives, empaths or people interested in extrasensory perception.

The chatroom mostly serves as a place to chill and chat about anything, including topical things like psychics! Our rules are pretty simple, you can find them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/wiki/index/chatroom#wiki_rules.2Fguidelines). We also have a good resource for IRC information and help [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/wiki/index/chatroom) if ever it's required.

**What inspired this community?**

It was on a sunny April in 2016, when our resident Dane Luhaja was on a walk through Denmark, when something came to him. The wind, breezed across his face, as he attempted mindfulness. Finally, a psychic connection was made, and a vision came to him, "We need a chatroom".
Some say he frantically* ran to his computer, made a post to {{< subreddit_link Psychic >}} in the hopes that his dreams would come true.
Then, a mod appeared. They agreed, and the chatroom was made.
The rest, as they say, is history.

*might be slightly embellished

**What sets your community apart from others?**

We are the largest psychic-related IRC channel (and subreddit) and we've all developed a close bond with each other.

There's also the fact that we have literal occultists and spirit talkers here but that's neither here nor there.

**What is your goal with this community?**

To create a chat for people with like-minded beliefs, but also to create a healthy environment that everyone can feel welcome to.

**Does your community have any traditions or special events?**

Aside from a secret santa/exchange we do, not particularly. Meetups have been organised before though.
