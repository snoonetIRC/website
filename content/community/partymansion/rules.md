We want ##PartyMansion to be a fun place for hedonism, coke, booze, strippers, and Dr Phil worship. Don't be a dick and spoil the party for everyone else.
Since "don't be a dick" seems to be misunderstood, here is a comprehensive list of rules in place that you will need to follow in order for ##PartyMansion to remain a happy place of food porn, shitty music, and poor meme-ing.

##PartyMansion's Rules:

1. **Don't be a dick**. -- To expand, don't do anything to intentionally attack another user. If a channel op requests for you to stop; stop. Failure to do so will result in a kick/quiet, and possibly a channel ban. Depending on the nature of the incident, the ban may be permanent. We have a very strong no-dick policy.

2. **No real names!** Refrain from using the names of users in the channel - respect their right to privacy and refer to them by their IRC nicks only.

3. **Don't be a dick.**

4. **No homophobic/racist/transphobic/sexist or otherwise discriminatory language or sentiments.** Please bear in mind that not everyone is from the same walk of life as you are, words you might find acceptable can be offensive to others. In these cases, please refer to Rule #1.

5. **Don't be a dick.**

6. **No excessive bot spam.** Bots in their nature can be very spammy and we understand this, but please respect the channel and exercise restraint.

7. **Don't be a dick.**

8. **No flooding.** If you have logs or something similar to post, put them in a paste at either privatepaste.com or pastebin.com.

9. **Don't be a dick.**

10. **Tag your NSFW pictures/links.**

11. **Don't be a dick.**

12. **Lurking is discouraged.** We regularly remove lurkers from the channel, so please make an attempt to be part of the community. This is us looking out for our channel regulars and not a slight on you -- a channel filled with lurkers is a channel filled with potential leaks. Lurking in its broadest sense is failure to participate in the channel after multiple warnings/pings, yet being active elsewhere.

If any problems arise, feel free to contact a channel op/halfop via PM.

**--Please note that all kicks/bans are at the discretion of the channel ops. If you have concerns with any of the decisions made then please contact one of the ops via private message so as not to disrupt the channel further--**


Thanks
