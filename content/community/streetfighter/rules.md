## Channel Rules

Everyone is welcome as long as they can follow these rules, as well as the [Snoonet Network Rules](https://www.snoonet.org/rules):

- Be kind to each other! **Don't be rude, don't have a temper, and don't be discriminatory**. Show the people around you respect, and they'll reciprocate.

- Mark all NSFW links as such.

- Please keep arguments civil. If things start to get out of hand, take it to a private message.

Please check back here every so often. The rules are a bit fluid and may change. It's always a good idea to keep up to date!

## Guide to a Pleasant IRC Experience

Follow this quick guide for a more enjoyable IRC experience.

- Use /nick <name> to change your irc nick. We'd recommend your Reddit username, but it's not required.

- Use /msg nickserv register <name> <password> to create an account for your nick. This is a great way to make sure nobody can ever impersonate you.

- Use /msg NickServ AJOIN ADD #streetfighter to add this channel to your autojoin list so that you'll automatically join when you connect to SnooNet.

- When looking for a game, state your region and platform. It'll help you find other players faster. Example: "<AceDrgn> Anyone want to play SF4? I'm in the US on PC"

- We have a really cool bot with commands like .schedule and .streams that'll give you the schedule for whatever tournaments might be going on, as well as what Twitch channels they're streaming on.

## Links to Useful Information Outside of IRC

The following are various links you might find useful in improving your SF4 game.
