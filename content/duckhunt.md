Duck hunt is a little mini-game provided by [gonzobot](/gonzobot). When a duck appears in a channel with the game enabled, you can befriend it or shoot it. Ducks will spawn after the game has been started after a period of time with channel activity.

# Commands

Gonzobot commands can be triggered by placing a period in front of the command. For example, to befriend a duck you should type: `.bef`.

`starthunt` - This command starts a duckhunt in your channel.

`stophunt` - This command stops the duck hunt in your channel. Scores will be preserved

`bang` - When a duck has spawned, you can use this command to shoot it.

`befriend` or `bef` - When a duck has spawned, you can use this command to befriend it.

`duckkick <enable|disable>` - If gonzobot has OP or Half-OP in the channel, then enabling this will kick people for trying to shoot or befriend a duck when one hasn't spawned.

`friends` - Prints a list of the top duck friends in the channel, if 'global' is specified all channels in the database are included.

`killers` - Prints a list of the top duck killers in the channel, if 'global' is specified all channels in the database are included.

`ducks [nick]` - Prints a nickname's duck stats. If no nickname is specified, it prints your duck stats.

`duckstats` - Prints duck statistics for the entire channel and totals for the network.
