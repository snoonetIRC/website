<p>We&rsquo;ve refreshed our <a href=/rules>Network Rules</a> and updated our <a href=/tos>Terms of Service</a> to make things easier to understand. These changes will go into effect as Monday, October 23rd, 2017 at 05:00 GMT. Your continued use of Snoonet after this date and time will constitute your acceptance of these changes.</p>
<h2 id=important-to-know>Important to know</h2>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve not made any major changes to our rules for some time. In fact, the only major changes we&rsquo;ve made are to update some of the information as certain pieces were out of date. We&rsquo;ve also moved certain items to different categories to make an easier read. You will now easily be able to find what you are looking for.</li>
<li>Our Terms of Service have been updated to include that we run an Open Proxy Monitor on our network. This information has previously been communicated in our MOTD, shown to all users when they connect to Snoonet.</li>
<li>Our Terms of Service have been updated to include how we protect our users from abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, we encourage you to join
<a href=https://webchat.snoonet.org/#snoonet>#snoonet</a> and ask your question there.</p>
<p>Thanks for using Snoonet!</p>

<p>IRC is an old protocol that can finally benefit from a face lift to make our modern clients better to use. Please look <a href=http://ircv3.net/>at the IRCv3 project here</a> and check out our road map. The aim is to upgrade the protocol of IRC to provide better functionality of future developments.

<section class=content><p>Today, Snoonet is pleased to announce our newest partner - Private Internet Access!</p>
<p>Owned by London Trust Media, Private Internet Access is a provider of consumer VPN services. Their sponsorship couldn&rsquo;t come at a better time as Snoonet continues to grow and develop new, innovative things for its communities!</p>
<p>Private Internet Access have generously donated $25,000 to Snoonet to assist with community building efforts. In addition, they have provided us with 11 new servers which will be equally dispersed among our geographic profile as needed. We are extremely grateful to them for this as it&rsquo;ll allow us to focus on bigger and better things as we finish up with 2016 and head in to 2017!</p>
<p>To celebrate this new, exciting partnership, Private Internet Access would like to give away 5,000 accounts with a free 1-year subscription to the service. These are available on a first come, first serve basis and Snoonet will initially be giving out only 500. If you&rsquo;d like one, fill out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ot_vyJ5ak77X_qSCsQupPmUpcNe9x3hpGd7aXAGiSUA/viewform?ts=5852bf5a&edit_requested=true">request form</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been chatter about Snoonet, or myself Shane &ldquo;rdv&rdquo; Allen individually as Snoonet&rsquo;s owner that we log all traffic on Snoonet, which is incorrect. I&rsquo;ll clarify in a short, simple post.</p>
<p>These accusations are false, the logs are fabricated, and targeted to hinder Snoonet&rsquo;s vision. Snoonet does not log messages on its network, or have any ability to spy on its users. <a href=/staff>The staff</a> all work together to keep each other accountable for their actions. I would be no exception, even as Snoonet&rsquo;s owner.</p>
<p>However the users on Snoonet do keep private logs of the channels they are in, which can not be avoided on any platform.</p>
<p>I personally was doxxed, harassed, threatened, and belittled. However, I&rsquo;ll take one for the team.</p>
<p>I made a post clarifying the situation <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/5igq1w/snoonet_owner_bans_techsupport_over_a_minor/>here on reddit</a></p>
<h2 id=ssl>SSL</h2>
<p>If you feel your messages are being spied on by your internet service provider, the government, or even on Snoonet&rsquo;s end, please connect to irc.snoonet.org on port 6697.
We have a signed certificate for secure authentication.
If you need help setting up your IRC client, please ask in #help</p>
<h2 id=extra-security-online>Extra security online</h2>
<p>Snoonet will be working directly with <a href=https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/>Private Internet Access</a> to provide users with home VPNs for their home devices. This will help increase anonymity if users such are looking for extra security online.
The details have not yet been worked out on its partnership, however we look to have the ability to offer free, or reduced payment to users on Snoonet.</p>
