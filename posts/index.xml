      <title>Updates to IRC.com infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2021/06/20/updates-to-irc-com-infrastructure/</link>

      <description>From: Network Director (duck@snoonet.org)
Good afternoon,
In 2018, Snoonet announced a partnership with IRC.com and made several changes to the network to support the services that they were introducing. These included a brand new IRC network running on modern IRC software, as well as a Bouncer-as-a-Service product which is still available and can be utilized with a custom application on the web, or on compatible Androidand Appledevices.
Starting today, Snoonet will begin implementing changes which will separate the IRC.com network from Snoonet. We will introduce some minor changes as soon as possible, with the eventual removal of IRC.com servers from Snoonet to follow in the coming days. If you currently use irc.irc.com to connect and wish to remain on our network, please update your IRC clients now to use irc.snoonet.org. If you registered a NickServ account on IRC.com, your account will be retained in our database and you will be able to use your existing credentials to authenticate on Snoonet.
Additionally, users that currently have a vhost of irc.com/user/name will have their vhost changed to user/name. Users with a snoonet.org/user/name will have the option to change to user/name.
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact a Snoonet operator in #help, or open a ticket at https://support.snoonet.org/
Thank you for using Snoonet!</description>

      <title>Services maintenance update: October 2020</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2020/10/23/services-update-oct-2020/</link>

      <description>From: Network Director (duck@snoonet.org)
Good afternoon,
On October 23rd, we carried out maintenance on our services package to fix an issue with respect to account registrations. While carrying out the maintenance, our services package behaved unexpectedly and after an investigation, we determined that some recent database changes are not recoverable and are thusly declaring an incident resulting in the loss of data.
If you registered an account on Snoonet, grouped a nickname to an existing account, registered a channel or made any changes to the access list of an existing channel, then please read the following information carefully.
What exactly happened? Whilst conducting maintenance, we noted that Anope was not saving its database correctly and was instead storing all recent changes in memory. While attempting to render a fix, Anope suffered a segmentation fault which terminated its program. The fault that terminated the program was caused as Anope was trying to save its database.
How will Snoonet respond? Upon declaring the data loss incident, we made the decision to restore the last backup that would work successfully. The backup was taken on October 4th at shortly after midnight (00:00) UTC. Any changes that were made after this time have been lost.
We&amp;rsquo;ve also added information to our logon news concerning the data loss incident.
For users that registered an account on or after the 4th of October, we have reached out to them directly to advise of the incident.
We will be immediately implementing stricter testing guidelines for any future software or configuration changes to avoid a repeat situation.
I realize that this situation is not ideal for some people and I offer my apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused you. If you have any concerns, you can either ask our network staff by joining #help. You can also reach out to me directly via private message on the network or by email at duck@snoonet.org.</description>

      <title>Your client and InspIRCd</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2020/07/13/client-upgrades/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 18:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2020/07/13/client-upgrades/</guid>
      <description>We are currently working on upgrading our network to InspIRCd v3. Older versions of some IRC clients (listed below) do not follow the IRC specification correctly and can not handle the way that InspIRCd v3 emits messages. More information about this can be found in the InspIRCd FAQ.
This update will keep us moving towards implementing cool new IRCv3 features.
Who needs to upgrade? You may recently have noticed messages from a network bot suggesting you run software updates.
A large majority of our users are not affected. However, if you are using a client older than the minimum version specified in the table below, you may start to see broken behaviour in some cases.
If you still use any version of XChat we recommend upgrading to HexChat.
   Client Minimum version     AdiIRC v3.6   HexChat v2.14.3   irssi v1.1.0   WeeChat v2.5.0   ZNC v1.8.0    </description>

      <title>Important changes to Snoonet and a partnership with IRC.com</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2018/11/22/important-changes-to-snoonet-and-a-partnership-with-irccom/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 21:38:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2018/11/22/important-changes-to-snoonet-and-a-partnership-with-irccom/</guid>
      <description>Snoonet is expanding its family and linking up with the new IRC network, IRC.com. For Snoonet users, the only real change you&amp;rsquo;ll feel is an influx of new users with some new cloaks. Staff wise, we are taking on no new opers over the link, and all current staff will remain as they are.
In order to reduce confusion between Snoonet and IRC.com users, a few changes will be made to cloaking and services bots. For most users, these changes will not be noticeable. Note that all these changes may not happen at once, for example, the cloak changes will take a bit more time than the rest.
1. Services will now display a vHost of @services instead of @snoonet/services/*. For example NickServ!NickServ@snoonet/services/NickServ will now simply be NickServ!NickServ@services.
2. vHosts for newly registered users will now either display @irc.com/user/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt; or @snoonet.org/user/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt; depending on which side of the network the user registered on.
3. Default and Snoo-ed nicks will change from SnooXXXXX to GuestXXXXX in order to be more network agnostic. Note that this will also affect how services force-nicks users to protect nicknames. As we understand that a number of channels ban Snoo-ed nicks we are providing a grace period of 7 days to channel operators to update their ban lists.
4. Unregistered users will now display a cloak containing @irc-&amp;lt;hash&amp;gt;.IP instead of @Snoonet-&amp;lt;hash&amp;gt;.IP. Note that this will not affect old bans against Snoonet-.IP cloaks, both types will be checked where needed.
TL;DR: The vHosts services bots use are changing to be more name agnostic. We&amp;rsquo;re making newly registered nicks have vhosts based on the side they registered on. We&amp;rsquo;re changing snoo-ed nicks to Guest. Cloaks are also undergoing changes to be more name agnostic, though bans on old ones will still work.
If you have any questions or concerns please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to ask a Snoonet staff member in #help or through our support system located at https://support.snoonet.org/</description>

      <title>Updates to our Privacy Policy and Services</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2018/05/24/updates-to-our-privacy-policy-and-services/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2018 20:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2018/05/24/updates-to-our-privacy-policy-and-services/</guid>
      <description>As part of our ongoing mission to serve our users and their communities, Snoonet is implementing some changes to our services and our policies to better reflect our commitment to privacy and security. Specifically, we have made some changes in support of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect on May 25, 2018.
A brief overview of some of the changes:  Our new Privacy Policy will come into effect on May 25, 2018. The revised policy doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the amount of data that we request from you, or impact how we use it.
Instead, the policy provides more details about the information we collect, how we use it, and how we comply with GDPR and other privacy legislation. We have also provided information about how to request the removal of your information from both our IRC network and from services like our support system. As announced yesterday, we no longer offer the Statistics bot as a network service, and have purged all data collected by the service. For more information, please visit the Statistics page. We have updated the messages that are sent to you upon connecting to our IRC network to notify you of our revised Privacy Policy and to seek your consent to these changes.  Additional information Privacy and security have been a long-term priority for us at Snoonet, and you can review our Privacy and Security page for additional information about our network&amp;rsquo;s privacy features, steps that you can take to protect your privacy when using our services, and some answers to frequently asked questions.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to be aware that by using our services on or after May 25, 2018, you will be agreeing to the changes outlined in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these changes, it is important that you stop using our services and take steps to delete your accounts and data. For more information, please consult the policy or contact us through our support system at https://support.snoonet.org.</description>

      <description>From: Snoonet Management We&amp;rsquo;ve refreshed our Network Rules and updated our Terms of Service to make things easier to understand. These changes will go into effect as Monday, October 23rd, 2017 at 05:00 GMT. Your continued use of Snoonet after this date and time will constitute your acceptance of these changes.
Important to know  We&amp;rsquo;ve not made any major changes to our rules for some time. In fact, the only major changes we&amp;rsquo;ve made are to update some of the information as certain pieces were out of date. We&amp;rsquo;ve also moved certain items to different categories to make an easier read. You will now easily be able to find what you are looking for. Our Terms of Service have been updated to include that we run an Open Proxy Monitor on our network. This information has previously been communicated in our MOTD, shown to all users when they connect to Snoonet. Our Terms of Service have been updated to include how we protect our users from abuse.  If you have any questions, we encourage you to join #snoonet and ask your question there.
Thanks for using Snoonet!</description>

      <description>Today, Snoonet is pleased to announce our newest partner - Private Internet Access!
Owned by London Trust Media, Private Internet Access is a provider of consumer VPN services. Their sponsorship couldn&amp;rsquo;t come at a better time as Snoonet continues to grow and develop new, innovative things for its communities!
Private Internet Access have generously donated $25,000 to Snoonet to assist with community building efforts. In addition, they have provided us with 11 new servers which will be equally dispersed among our geographic profile as needed. We are extremely grateful to them for this as it&amp;rsquo;ll allow us to focus on bigger and better things as we finish up with 2016 and head in to 2017!
To celebrate this new, exciting partnership, Private Internet Access would like to give away 5,000 accounts with a free 1-year subscription to the service. These are available on a first come, first serve basis and Snoonet will initially be giving out only 500. If you&amp;rsquo;d like one, fill out our request form.

      <description>Our Privacy Mission There&amp;rsquo;s been chatter about Snoonet, or myself Shane &amp;ldquo;rdv&amp;rdquo; Allen individually as Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s owner that we log all traffic on Snoonet, which is incorrect. I&amp;rsquo;ll clarify in a short, simple post.
These accusations are false, the logs are fabricated, and targeted to hinder Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s vision. Snoonet does not log messages on its network, or have any ability to spy on its users. The staff all work together to keep each other accountable for their actions. I would be no exception, even as Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s owner.
However the users on Snoonet do keep private logs of the channels they are in, which can not be avoided on any platform.
I personally was doxxed, harassed, threatened, and belittled. However, I&amp;rsquo;ll take one for the team.
I made a post clarifying the situation here on reddit
SSL If you feel your messages are being spied on by your internet service provider, the government, or even on Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s end, please connect to irc.snoonet.org on port 6697. We have a signed certificate for secure authentication. If you need help setting up your IRC client, please ask in #help
Extra security online Snoonet will be working directly with Private Internet Access to provide users with home VPNs for their home devices. This will help increase anonymity if users such are looking for extra security online. The details have not yet been worked out on its partnership, however we look to have the ability to offer free, or reduced payment to users on Snoonet.
If you would like to apply/be in the queue for a Private Internet Access VPN, make a post with this form Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s Mission Statement This is a reminder of what Snoonet is about. Trolls will not sway this vision.</description>

      <description>Channel Verification Process We developed a new tool that channels can enable. When enabled, new users joining a channel will need to verify via the web in order to earn voice status (able to speak in a +m moderated channel) . This will hinder ban evaders and gives staff new options to work with to help deter and stop abusive users. It can be used in event channels with large amounts of users, or used as a tool to force people to make an effort to chat in the channel. The inner workings behind the engine will be explained in detail to the #optalk crew before making it public to all channels as a service on Snoonet.
How it works  User joins channel User is sent a link to a secure website to prove they are a real person Magic happens on our backend After visiting the URL sent to them, mode +v is applied to their nickname  You may currently request this verification process on your channel by asking in #snoonet or #optalk.</description>

      <description>Snoonet recognizes that privacy and security are key issues for many of our users. It is our goal to ensure that our network is safe and your data is secure. We take a number of steps to protect users&amp;rsquo; privacy and limit the information that is exchanged on our network. We protect your privacy in the following ways:
IPs are hidden by default for all users with umode +x and replaced by a one-way hash in the users host. For unregistered users, their IP will be replaced with Snoonet-hash.IP. Registered users receive a vHost, user/AccountName.
Registration information, including e-mail addresses, are hidden in the user&amp;rsquo;s NickServ info. Users may select to hide additional information as well with /ns help set hide
User channels are not visible in their WHOIS by others and is automatically set on connect with the umode +I. Users may elect to disable this user mode if they wish. Private and secret channels are never displayed to users not also in those channels, regardless of the user mode setting.
Private messages can be restricted by users with a variety of user modes. PMs can be limited to users in common channels, registered users, or a configured whitelist. See User Modes for more information.
For more information on how Snoonet protects you, ways you can protect yourself, and frequently asked questions, please see our Privacy and Security page. If you have any questions, feel free to ask a staff member in #help.</description>

      <description>Network Conduct  Solicitation of services to earn financial gain is only permitted by asking the channel operators. No user is to request money from others. While we understand many are in times of need, please register a gofundme account and state why you are asking for money. Please ask permission from the channel operators. Begging, and contacting multiple users requesting money is a network offense and will be dealt with warnings and removal from the network.  Channel Rules  Channels may be freely registered on Snoonet, however if subreddit moderators claim an already-registered channel with the same name as their subreddit it shall be granted upon request. Communities that have existed on Snoonet for a long period of time will be granted special exemptions. To prevent hostile takeovers of channels, Snoonet operations staff will work with the entire mod team of the subreddit to find the best solution.  </description>

      <title>Hello SubWatch, Farewell rAnnouncer</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/11/29/hello-subwatch-farewell-rannouncer/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to introduce SubWatch, a new bot on our network. Subwatch announces new reddit threads on your channel from subreddits of your choosing, and will be replacing rAnnouncer, which is being decommissioned. You will need to transfer your settings in order for your channel to continue receiving thread alerts.
To switch between rAnnouncer and SubWatch, please take the following steps:
• Type \subreddit list to view rAnnouncer&amp;rsquo;s subreddits.
• /invite SubWatch #channel to have SubWatch join your channel.
• Type $add [subreddit name] for each of the subreddits you wish to transfer.
• /kick #channel rAnnouncer
Please note: you must be a channel operator or halfop to use these commands.
Want to keep a close eye on your subreddit? SubWatch is also capable of announcing threads based on keywords in the title, and can securely announce threads from private subreddits.
You can view the commands and further information here.</description>

      <description>We know that many communities are concerned about privacy for their users. To that end, in addition to masking user&amp;rsquo;s IPs, we are now setting +I as a default usermode.
What does this mean? Unless you /umode -I, users will now be unable to see channels that you are in. If you wish -I to persist, please type /msg nickserv keepmodes on
Looking for new channels? If you are looking to find new channels, please visit the communities page.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like your channel to be added to this list, please ask in #help or submit a ticket here.</description>

      <title>The ducks are migrating...</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/10/24/the-ducks-are-migrating/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2015 22:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/10/24/the-ducks-are-migrating/</guid>
      <description>Something spooky is happening on Snoonet. The ducks must have been scared off by something&amp;hellip;where did they go? Wait&amp;hellip;that looks like meatcat, running for dear life out of #foreveralone! Did they finally chase him off? &amp;hellip;WAIT! Is that a zombie behind him?
It&amp;rsquo;s time to choose: you can .bang the monsters and save your fellow redditors or .bef the monsters and let them eat all of your friends.
Later today, the monster hunt will be released.
Rules:  All hunting must be done in a channel with at least 10 other people hunting. If you invite gonzobot into #mycoolmonsterhunting channel and there are not 10 other people actively hunting with you you will be disqualified from the contest. The highest average number of kills will win, so killing monsters in 100+ channels will not help you out at all. If there are other ways people find to cheat the system, those involved will be disqualified. Data analysis will be done before the winners are selected. To qualify in the contest, nicknames must be registered or grouped under a registered account.  Prizes:  Each winner will be given 2 custom vhost coupons which will entitle them to a custom hostname of their choosing, within reason. Winners can choose to give one or both of these coupons away, or use them both for themselves. If you would like to add to the pot by donating extra Humble Bundle license keys or anything else, please modmail /r/snoonet. We will distribute rewards as evenly as we can between the two winners. We&amp;rsquo;d be happy to promote any additional contributions, including who or what communities have donated the prizes. We will include any updates to the prize list here and anywhere else that the contest is announced, including /r/snoonet and @snoonet.  </description>

      <title>Snoonet Bouncer Access on KiwiIRC</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/03/16/snoonet-bouncer-access-on-kiwiirc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/03/16/snoonet-bouncer-access-on-kiwiirc/</guid>
      <description>We are pleased to announce that KiwiIRC now allows you to connect with Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s bouncer (BNC) service. Web BNC can be accessed at https://webbnc.snoonet.org. This change should enable more users to access our BNC service and use it on a regular basis.
Prawnsalad, creator of KiwiIRC, has been working closely with our development team in order to make this possible. We would like to thank prawnsalad for his effort and his contributions to Snoonet. It is always a pleasure to work with someone who goes the extra mile to improve the user experience for our community.
 What is a BNC?
A BNC (or Bouncer) is a service which keeps you connected to IRC 24/7. Instead of connecting directly to Snoonet, you connect to the bouncer, which stays connected. The bouncer will play back messages which you missed while you were disconnected. This way, you can always be part of the conversation. How do I get one?
Once you have a nick registered with NickServ for one month, you are eligible to request a BNC. You need to join ##bnc and type /requestbnc. Then, wait for an operator to approve your request. Usually this is done within an hour or two. When your request is approved, details on connecting to your account will be sent to your account via MemoServ. To read them, type /ms read new  Please see our BNC page for more information on Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s BNC service.</description>

      <title>Update on Snoonet&#39;s custom vhost program</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/03/12/update-on-snoonets-custom-vhost-program/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/03/12/update-on-snoonets-custom-vhost-program/</guid>
      <description>A month ago, we trialed a new service allowing users to request a custom vhost of their choosing, provided the custom host didn&amp;rsquo;t contain any slurs or violate any pre-existing network rules.
Due to consensus among network staff and preparation for potential future network updates, we have decided to end this trial service.
Users will no longer be allowed to apply for custom vhosts, but users who received custom vhosts before today will be able to keep them if they wish to do so. Those with custom vhosts who wish to revert back to a normal @user/accountname vhost should ask in #help and an oper will switch the vhost back.
Community vhosts, e.g. @xboxone/XenoBen, can still be requested for users with flags in any channel which has over 40 members. If you have flags in a snoonet community or chat channel which meets the member requirement, you can request a custom @communityname/accountname vhost by typing /vhost #channel, or asking for assistance in #help.
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our vhost services, you can ask an oper in #snoonet (for general questions) or #help (for technical questions).</description>

      <title>In Remembrance of Edify</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/02/28/in-remembrance-of-edify/</link>

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2015/02/28/in-remembrance-of-edify/</guid>
      <description>Former long-time Snoonet network operator and reddit moderator /u/edify, remembered as Jarod Coonce by his friends and family, has passed away. He was known for organizing television AMAs, and made the television community on reddit &amp;ndash; from /r/thewalkingdead to /r/breakingbad &amp;ndash; what it is today.
Jarod continued his role on Snoonet as a community manager, bringing countless communities to the network during its formative years. He selflessly helped in any way he could. Jarod single-handedly introduced over 300 users to Snoonet overnight by bringing attention to the #BreakingBad subreddit IRC channel, and bringing Live AMAs to the network from Breaking Bad actors. He truly was a force for change, and he will be missed.
Snoonet extends our best wishes to his family and friends. He will be remembered far after his departure not only by us, but by his fellow moderators and the many people his actions touched.
You can find a link to most of the AMAs edify organized here. One of his favorite charities was A Place Called Home, a safe haven for children and teens in Los Angeles. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to donate in his name, you can do so here.</description>

      <title>Rule Additions</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2014/07/09/rule-additions/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2014/07/09/rule-additions/</guid>
      <description>Snoonet operations reserve the right to set temporary and permanent channel modes on any channel or user during attacks, to protect users from harmful spam messages (containing, or not containing), malicious dox (private information), malicious software/web pages, viruses, spam, flood. This rule will not allow for censorship and will only be considered when multiple users become targets for attackers. No private channels will be affected.
Examples of modes: Setting channels to registered users only, modifying flood-toggles for channels, making users only receive messages from others that are familiar in channels, and incorporating the network utility sysop (System Operator) in channels where attacks are popular.
Privacy In addition to the no-dox rule. Posting of information about anybody&amp;rsquo;s private life, school, home, hobbies and interests are prohibited unless publicly shared on the network, or a verbal agreement is given by the individual on which information is shared. Sharing information about yourself is at your discretion, and we will not punish any user for information that you shared in a public chat. Punishment of this rule will result in a ban from the network ranging from one month to permanent dismissal. To sum it up, nothing that a reasonable person would deem as &amp;lsquo;private information&amp;rsquo; may be shared with others. We will enforce it by looking in to how the information can be abused, or used to one&amp;rsquo;s advantage before issuing a warning or ban.</description>

      <title>BNC, Subreddit VHOST, and powerful user channel modes</title>
      <link>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2014/05/07/bnc-subreddit-vhost-and-powerful-user-channel-modes/</link>

      <description>Want to always have your IRC nick connected? Be able to log in to your IRC nickname and resume your session from any computer, or device, from any any where at any time. We now offer BNC access for our users to connect to. This is a service that keeps an IRC nickname always connected to Snoonet and displays messages and chats you might have normally missed as soon as you log on. The service only allows you to have a bouncer (software: ZNC) connected to Snoonet, but will remain connected to Snoonet forever. If you do not log on the service for one full week, the bouncer will automatically be removed, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have to apply again.
 /requestbnc - Type this command in any window on IRC and wait for a MemoServ/e-mail to be sent. You must be registered with NickServ to obtain access.  Big fan of a certain subreddit? Want a subreddit vhost? All you need is ChanServ access to the subreddit&amp;rsquo;s channel! User vhosts mask your address as *@subreddit/username  /vhost #subredditchannel - Only subreddits with 45 users or more in the channel will be accepted. This is to deter creating a subreddit or channel and having any mask desired.  New Powerful IRC Modes Our IRC sofrware now allows powerful channel modes to be set to control user population, spam attacks, or simply making your IRC chat easier to read and manage. Check out the channel mode list here! We&amp;rsquo;ve provided some documentation, but if you need more assistance feel free to ask us in #help on Snoonet.
Client Modes to make IRC easier Again, our IRC software now allows for powerful usermodes to be set (/umode +modeshere) with features that can help the busiest of moderators and those wanting more privacy. Check out the user modes here! If you need any help, feel free to ask us in #help on Snoonet</description>

      <description>On Apr. 28, 2014 Snoonet will be turning 2 years old! Many of the top 50 subreddit&amp;rsquo;s well respected mods have made a name for themselves as staff on the network. Alongside a few reddit admins that operate behind the scenes, we&amp;rsquo;d like to thank the subreddits and the users of Snoonet for calling our IRC network their chat home.
What makes us unique? We are the first and only IRC network welcoming community oriented chats for reddit.com - We were created by rdv and Paradox who at the time was a reddit.com admin looking to give more to the community. We have an API backend to allow subreddits to easily configure and set up a chat on the network for their subreddits, bringing live chat straight from the threads.
For our second birthday we&amp;rsquo;d like to give back! Visit us in /r/Snoonet and post a thread with idea(s) we can offer to the users!
As of today, our top 10 consistent IRC communities are:
#reddit (Owners: Paradox, rdv)
#Games (Owners: Deimorz, Pharnaces)
#news (Owner: douglasmacarthur)
#f1 (Owners: Kreius, Vilkku, opiates)
#sex (Owner: Elderthedog)
#subredditdrama (Owner: MillenniumFalc0n)
#TechSupport (Owner: Mikee)
#android (Owner: IAmAN00bie)
#bicycling (Owner: Wiggee)
#anxiety (Owner: aperson)

      <guid>https://staging.snoonet.org/posts/2013/12/08/nickserv-ajoin/</guid>
      <description>This post is a PSA about a NickServ module we&amp;rsquo;ve recently enabled that will allow you to be auto-joined to a list of channels you&amp;rsquo;ve set upon identifying. This should be especially useful to webchat users due to the lack of client-side auto-join. To add a channel to your autojoin list use /msg nickserv ajoin add #channelname
To delete a channel from your autojoin list use /msg nickserv ajoin del #channelname
To see the channels currently on your autojoin list you can use /msg nickserv ajoin list
As a reminder, you can get information and help with syntax on any NickServ or ChanServ command by messaging the appropriate service &amp;ldquo;help command&amp;quot;. So to see the syntax for the ajoin command you would do /msg nickserv help ajoin</description>

      <description>IRC News On Wednesday, Jan. 16 we will be issuing patches and features for the Snoonet Webchat. We are creating a backend for channels to be managed through a webpanel which will be the alpha stage for reddit/other communities&amp;rsquo; users to remotely set up/modify/view/update their community&amp;rsquo;s IRC channel access lists and settings, including ban lists and invex lists. For other IRC networks out there, check out www.kiwiirc.com as the developer has a lot of goals and a lot of options available to bring a live webchat to your network.
We will be creating a few customized IRC bots that will offer a variety of options for different types of communities.
Some examples will be a VIP-Ask Me Anything robot which will moderate the channel, and accept questions for VIPs to answer directly. The system will work by users submitting a question, and a moderator will approve the question. The questions will remain in a queue until the user is voiced, the bot states the question and the VIP and the user have a short period of time to ask and answer questions before moving on. All questions, answers, and conversation will be compiled in to a markup post which can easily be posted (or automatically) to a reddit thread where the Ask Me Anything thread may possibly continue.
A channel protection bot for channel operators/moderators to utilize and change the settings of to set a &amp;lsquo;bad words&amp;rsquo; type filter list, where they may set punishments for bad words, phrases, links, etc. The bot will also have options to control punishing flooding/repeat lines/repeat offenders, as well as manage the ban lists. This is for channels that grow in size and need moderation while operators/mods aren&amp;rsquo;t around. For those familiar with our network bot &amp;lsquo;sysop&amp;rsquo; - it will be a user controlled/managed bot controlled by channel mods.
While the above may be boring/uninteresting to some,
Games Our network co-founder Paradox and network operator, Ricin will be hosting a large-scale Minecraft server for users to play on. More news will be posted about it as they will require help in moderating the server/keeping an eye on things. If you have any suggestions for other games you&amp;rsquo;d like hosted, feel free to contact us in SnoonetGaming, /r/irc or e-mail support [at] snoonet.org.
We have the resources to host multiple game servers, and will be hosting these servers while we code and produce the competitive gaming tournament aspect of Snoonet.</description>
