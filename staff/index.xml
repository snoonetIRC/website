      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m /u/noeatnosleep. Most people call me nens. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to type. I&amp;rsquo;m the LTM Liason and an Operations Manager for snoonet. I often help organize community events, work with newer users in #help, and assist people with network issues. I&amp;rsquo;m connected almost all the time, and if you ever want to chat, just shoot me a message! (/msg noeatnosleep hi)
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on snoonet from the beginning, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been on IRC for many years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been an IRCop on other networks, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found my home here. Snoonet is filled with folks that I enjoy being around. I&amp;rsquo;m often in #reddit, #politics, #srotd, #showgoat, #random, #games, and a bunch of private channels.
Personally, I love motorcycles, history, and tech. I moderate a bunch of related subreddits, but some of my favorites are /r/gadgets, which I am head moderator of, /r/motorcycles, /r/bikebuilders, /r/hackedgadgets and /r/ThisDayInHistory. I also run a little website that has some neat reddit tools and bots and related things on it: http://noeatnosleep.me. Check it out and give me feedback! I&amp;rsquo;m constantly updating it. Feel free to shoot me an email at noeatnosleep@snoonet.org if you need anything!</description>

      <description>Duck (duck@snoonet.org) Hello all, Duck here! Thanks for using Snoonet!
I&amp;rsquo;m part of the operations team, being primarily responsible for maintaining our server infrastructure and making sure things are up-to-date, as well as assisting the staff team with rule &amp;amp; guideline enforcement across the network as needed. I&amp;rsquo;m also involved with the InspIRCd project, whose software powers this network.
When I&amp;rsquo;m not doing network-related things, I can usually be found chatting in a handful of the communities that Snoonet hosts. If you see me, feel free to say hi, or send me a message at any time using /msg Duck Hi!

      <description>Alright? I&amp;rsquo;m DavidLuizsHair or DLH. Nice to meet you. I&amp;rsquo;m a recently appointed community admin. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on IRC intermittently throughout my teenage years, but have recently gotten back into it about a year ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on snoonet for about 10 months [as of drafting this message] so I&amp;rsquo;m still relatively quite young compared to others in that respect. I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty big sports fan mostly being a fan of football (soccer), formula 1 and intermittently following some NBA as well. In terms of other interests, I&amp;rsquo;m an avid fan of documentaries and I also intermittently cook, with varying results. Music wise I&amp;rsquo;m all over the board, I&amp;rsquo;m open to new kinds of music although various types of Indie, metalcore and rock tend to be my jam. Use /query DavidLuizsHair if you ever need any network help and I will do my best to help you. I go in phases of reading where I either read intensively or I don&amp;rsquo;t read at all, some of my favourite books include &amp;ldquo;To Kill A MockingBird&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Stranger&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Guest&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;By The Waters of Babylon.&amp;rdquo; Some of my favourite subreddits include /r/penmanshipporn, /r/soccer, /r/nba, /r/London and /r/BritishProblems.
The following statements below are compiled impressions of what IRC-ers who have interacted with me before describe me.
This is what my profile would look like if Ari created it: &amp;ldquo;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m DavidLuizsHair. I have like 70 nicknames on Snoonet, most of them animals for some reason. According to Meow_Mix, I like dog gifs and sportsball. Sportsball is the best. I&amp;rsquo;m going to recruit channels to Snoonet that are already here! GO SPORTS, DO THE THING, SCORE THE GOAL!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;DavidLuizsHair i just remembered i had a dream about you. o.0 You took over the world dressed like a KFC bucket.&amp;rdquo; - f5184
&amp;ldquo;If you weren&amp;rsquo;t here I&amp;rsquo;d be fully clothed&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;yes, and if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t here, you&amp;rsquo;d be breaking and entering&amp;rdquo; - owlet
&amp;ldquo;DavidLuizshair used confusion, it was super effective. DavidLuizsHair hurt itself in it&amp;rsquo;s confusion&amp;rdquo; - linuxdaemon
This is what my smile looks like as described by noeatnosleep: http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/gddy.gif
This is the pic Meow_Mix uses to describe me with: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5tqqzDnrt1qet66oo1_500.png
Well, if you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far. Have a pasta guide: http://pastafits.org/pasta-dictionary/</description>

      <description>Heyo! I&amp;rsquo;m ThatOneRoadie, also known as Thor or TOR, from Denver, Colorado, USA. I&amp;rsquo;m one of the Senior Network Operations Staff here at Snoonet, responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of our network of servers. It&amp;rsquo;s a responsibility that changes on a daily basis, encompassing things such as monitoring network routes, upgrading and maintaining our IRC Daemon on all of our hub and leaf servers, commissioning and decommissioning servers on the network, stress testing new servers, and load balancing the users on the leafs that are active. At any given time, I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for the chat network used by over 4500 people simultaneously.
The team of Network Operations Staffers here at Snoonet maintain over 13 Client Leaf servers, and a number of hidden hub servers operating as the backbone to our IRC network. The leaf servers are in many geographically diverse locations, from Los Angeles, USA, to Dublin, Ireland, and even servers in Singapore (clearly you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Singapore). We strive to keep these servers up-to-date with the latest security and software updates, protecting our users from any breach of data.
I, personally, maintain a number of servers for the Snoonet network, as well as a set of 16 blade servers and a 10TB SAN (Storage Area Network) in my home lab environment. In my free time, I tinker on this home lab with various virtual machines on an enterprise Cisco network. When I&amp;rsquo;m not doing that, I&amp;rsquo;m a student pilot here in the Denver area, working on my Private Pilot&amp;rsquo;s License.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Greenish and frankly I&amp;rsquo;m on IRC too much for my own good — guess that&amp;rsquo;s how I got this gig, though.
If I&amp;rsquo;m not skulking about the network I&amp;rsquo;m probably studying, fighting the urge to buy some stupid old hardware that no one cares about to do even stupider things with, or suffering the effects of temporary self-inflicted sanity loss due to the previously mentioned activities.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m jotun, a software engineer living in sunny California.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using IRC - and coding things for IRC - for nearly 20 years. You might&amp;rsquo;ve heard of my game, Idle RPG. If not, you can check it out in #idlerpg on Snoonet!
I discovered Snoonet about a year and a half ago and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to work with a network that combined two of my favorite things - IRC and reddit. Since joining, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some really wild experiences and met some amazing new friends.
If you like to code, or are interested in learning to code, stop by #programming and say hello!</description>

      <description>Hi,
I&amp;rsquo;m Madbrad200 - or just Brad! I&amp;rsquo;m usually using this nick or some variation of [word]brad200. If you need me for something, I can be found pretty much everywhere but I mostly chat in #Psychic, #textfriends or #mnfh. Feel free to also send me a pm with /query Madbrad200 Hi! or /msg Madbrad200 hi :D
About me: I&amp;rsquo;m from the UK (specifically Leicester, which is definitely not northern), I love art, music (primarily grime), politics, history, flags and just generally learning about weird things. I&amp;rsquo;m also particularly fond of interactive fiction but I haven&amp;rsquo;t wrote much of anything in a few years.
p.s I hate tea

      <description>Aloha! I am duk242
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on IRC for about 20 years now (Snoonet since 2017).
I chill in the #techsupport, #programming, #technology and #games channels for the most part.
IRL I&amp;rsquo;m an Aussie who likes games, gadgets and casual programming.
Feel free to say hi! I&amp;rsquo;m always up for a random chat about tech support, games or whatever.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m flotwig. You might have heard me called flotty, flotsam, Just Wiggy™, or thotwig.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on IRC since 2007 or 2008 and I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Snoonet since week two of its existence. Nowadays, I&amp;rsquo;m a more active IRCer than I am a redditor.
My favorite channels are ##PartyMansion, #safefromparadox, and #idlerpg.
Back in the day, I operated an IRC server for Snoonet. Now, I operate several smaller non-IRC servers. I run:
 Statistics: A bot which collects and computes various statistics about users. Status: A beta Snoonet status monitor, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to ask &amp;ldquo;is it just me?&amp;rdquo; next time you can&amp;rsquo;t connect. Unfortunately not quite finished because we are still transitioning over to Anope. Various internal systems, including mail and DNS for irc.snoonet.org.  I strongly believe in Snoonet&amp;rsquo;s ability to sustain growth for the future. We&amp;rsquo;ve come from being ecstatic at having a hundred users to regularly seeing bursts of over three thousand. At the time of this writing, we have 1,462 independent, user-created channels and 2,698 users online&amp;hellip; at 10 AM on a Sunday. Things are good and they&amp;rsquo;re getting better.

      <description>bloodygonzo (alumnus) I am the Network Director of Snoonet. My goal for Snoonet is to:
 Stabilize and secure the network with the best tools in automation, monitoring, and security. Build on the established team of volunteer staff to create an excellent experience for the communities on Snoonet. Provide an excellent end user experience for individuals on our network.  Additionally:
I run gonzobot on Snoonet and enjoy customizing him to fit the needs of the various communities on Snoonet. My favorite hobby right now is smoking meat and every weekend I get the chance I try and smoke brisket or pork shoulder, or beef short ribs. Feel free to message me if you have any questions about Snoonet or ideas for improvement using: /query bloodygonzo.
