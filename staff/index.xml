      <description>Duck duck [at] snoonet.org Hello all, Duck here! Thanks for flying Snoonet!
I joined staff in mid-2017 and presently oversee operations on the network as the Network Director. Part of my mission is to assist our staff with rules &amp;amp; guideline enforcement and to assist in the maintenance of our server infrastructure. I&amp;rsquo;m also involved with InspIRCd and DroneBL, both of which help keep this network ticking.
While not doing network-related things, I may be found chatting in a handful of the communities that we host. If you see me around, feel free to say hi, or send me a message at any time using /msg Duck Hi!

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m jotun, a software engineer living in sunny California.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using IRC - and coding things for IRC - for nearly 20 years. You might&amp;rsquo;ve heard of my game, Idle RPG. If not, you can check it out in #idlerpg on Snoonet!
I discovered Snoonet about a year and a half ago and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to work with a network that combined two of my favorite things - IRC and reddit. Since joining, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some really wild experiences and met some amazing new friends.
If you like to code, or are interested in learning to code, stop by #programming and say hello!</description>

      <description>Aloha! I am duk242
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on IRC for about 20 years now (Snoonet since 2017).
I chill in the #techsupport, #programming, #technology and #games channels for the most part.
IRL I&amp;rsquo;m an Aussie who likes games, gadgets and casual programming.
Feel free to say hi! I&amp;rsquo;m always up for a random chat about tech support, games or whatever.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m flotwig. You might have heard me called flotty, flotsam, Just Wiggy™, or thotwig.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on IRC since 2007 or 2008 and I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Snoonet since week two of its existence. Nowadays, I&amp;rsquo;m a more active IRCer than I am a redditor.
My favorite channels are #gnulag, ##PartyMansion, #safefromparadox, and #idlerpg.

      <description>bloodygonzo (alumnus) I am the Network Director of Snoonet. My goal for Snoonet is to:
 Stabilize and secure the network with the best tools in automation, monitoring, and security. Build on the established team of volunteer staff to create an excellent experience for the communities on Snoonet. Provide an excellent end user experience for individuals on our network.  Additionally:
I run gonzobot on Snoonet and enjoy customizing him to fit the needs of the various communities on Snoonet. My favorite hobby right now is smoking meat and every weekend I get the chance I try and smoke brisket or pork shoulder, or beef short ribs. Feel free to message me if you have any questions about Snoonet or ideas for improvement using: /query bloodygonzo.
