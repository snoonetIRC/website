      <description>General NickServ in-network help:
/msg NickServ HELP [COMMAND]
Without a [COMMAND] parameter, this will list the NickServ commands and descriptions. If you fill in the [command] parameter it will give you detailed instructions on that command.
 To use the awesome features from NickServ, you must first register your nick. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re using the nick that you want by typing:
/nick &amp;lt;nick&amp;gt;
Then type this to register your nick:
/msg NickServ REGISTER &amp;lt;password&amp;gt; &amp;lt;email&amp;gt;
Make sure that you use a valid email, as you&amp;rsquo;ll have to confirm that it is yours. If you don&amp;rsquo;t get the email you may have the server resend it to you using this command:
/msg NickServ RESEND
 Every time you join Snoonet after registering your nick, you&amp;rsquo;ll be prompted for your password. Just type this:
/msg NickServ IDENTIFY &amp;lt;password&amp;gt;
and you&amp;rsquo;ll be logged in!
Most clients offer a way to save your password so that you do not have to manually type it each time. For client specific help, visit #TechSupport.
 Forgot your password? No problem. Use this:
/msg NickServ RESETPASS &amp;lt;nick&amp;gt; &amp;lt;email&amp;gt;
 Sometimes you get disconnected, but your nick is still present on the network. When this happens you can regain control of your nick by typing:
/msg NickServ GHOST &amp;lt;nick&amp;gt; &amp;lt;password&amp;gt;
Or
/msg NickServ RECOVER &amp;lt;nick&amp;gt; &amp;lt;password&amp;gt;
 You can have multiple nicks. Just switch to the nick you want to add to your registered nick and type:
/msg NickServ GROUP &amp;lt;mainnick&amp;gt; &amp;lt;password&amp;gt;
to undo it, type: /msg NickServ UNGROUP [nick]
To see all the nicknames you have in your group, type:
/msg NickServ GLIST
 If you no longer wish to have your nickname registered, type:
/msg NickServ DROP &amp;lt;nick&amp;gt;
 To view the information about your nick, such as when you registered, type:
/msg NickServ INFO &amp;lt;nick&amp;gt;
 To edit the items that people can view about you with the INFO command such as your facebook or email, type:
/msg NickServ SET [option]
 You can also set up a list of channels to join automatically when you log in! The command for this is:
/msg NickServ AJOIN {ADD|DEL} [nickname] &amp;lt;channel&amp;gt; [key]
To view your autojoin channels, type:
/msg NickServ AJOIN LIST
List channels you have access on:
